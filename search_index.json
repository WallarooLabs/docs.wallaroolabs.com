this Guide\nWelcome to the developer's guide for Wallaroo. This document is available in a variety of formats including:\n\nOn the web\nPDF\nePub\nMobi\n\nYou can open issues and submit pull requests against our GitHub repo.\nThis document is has been written to take an application developer from zero knowledge about Wallaroo to being able to develop streaming Wallaroo applications in a local development environment using Go or Python. (For other languages such as C++, and for long-running data jobs such as large-scale analysis or model training, please contact us. Support and documentation are coming soon.)\nPlease contact us at hello@wallaroolabs.com about how we can help you with your particular data processing applications.\nIntended Audience\nWe designed this document for programmers that want to jump right in and get started using Wallaroo.  Starting with installing all of the necessary components required for Wallaroo and launching an example application in a local development environment.\nAlthough not required, you will get the most out of this tutorial if you have previous experience with Go and/or Python.  Additionally, experience with stream processing and distributed computing systems and concepts would be helpful.\nSupported development environments\nIt is currently possible to develop Wallaroo applications on MacOS and Linux. This guide has installation instructions for MacOS, and Ubuntu Linux. It's assumed if you are using a different Linux distribution that you are able to translate the Ubuntu instructions to your distribution of choice.\nWe also support development using a Docker container, installation instructions are included for MacOS and Ubuntu Linux.\nWhat to Expect\nThis document is organized into a number of sections. We recommend that you start in a linear fashion through this book. To that end, please consider reading in order:\n\n\"What is Wallaroo\"\n\"Core Concepts\"\n\"Developing with Wallaroo\"\n\nOnce you have finished the \"Developing with Wallaroo\" section, you can then jump to documentation for the language you will be developing with.\nCore Concepts\nCovers the concepts you'll need to understand in order to build a Wallaroo application.\nWallaroo with Python\nHow to develop Wallaroo applications using Python.\nThe \"Setting Up Your Environment for Wallaroo\" describes setting up your development environment and then compiling and running a Wallaroo application. The tools you will install then are useful when developing a Wallaroo application.\nThe Wallaroo Python API section takes you through a number of examples applications to teach you the Wallaroo Go API.\nWallaroo with Go\nHow to develop Wallaroo applications using Go.\nThe \"Setting Up Your Environment for Wallaroo\" describes setting up your development environment and then compiling and running a Wallaroo application.

It's designed for writing distributed data processing applications, especially demanding high-throughput, low-latency tasks where the accuracy of results is important. If you are familiar with the “big data” landscape, Wallaroo includes the “streaming data” category along with tools like Storm, Heron, and Samza. However, the core engine also supports long-running analysis such as might be used for large-scale analysis and model training.\nWhen we set out to build Wallaroo, we had a few goals in mind. We wanted to improve the state of the art for distributed data processing by providing better per-worker throughput, dramatically lower latencies, easier state management, and an easier operational experience. In this introduction, we're going to touch on some of these points but not all of them. Over the course of this guide, we will explore Wallaroo more in-depth. To that end, this introduction will:\n\nTake you through what Wallaroo is\nDescribe the problems Wallaroo is solving\nDiscuss some of the key features including integrated state management and exactly-once processing\n\nWallaroo by example: Market Spread\nLet’s start talking about what Wallaroo can do by way of an example. One demo application is one called “Market Spread.” It’s based on a proof-of-concept we did for a large bank that was looking at ways to modernize their infrastructure. Market Spread is an application designed to run alongside a trading system. Its goal is to monitor market data for irregularities around different symbols and potentially withdraw some trades that have been sent to market should certain anomalies occur.\nWhen we break the application down into its key components we get:\n\nA stream of market data, aka “NBBO Stream”\nA stream of trades, aka “Order Stream”\nState in the form of latest market conditions for various symbols\nA calculation to possibly withdraw the trade based on state for that symbol\n\n\nFor the proof of concept, our client was looking to handle hundreds of thousands of messages a second with median latencies measured in microseconds. Further, they needed flat, predictable tail latencies that were measured in single-digit milliseconds. While the proof of concept was only run on a single machine, the goal was to have an application that would be able to respond to ever-increasing rates of data and seamlessly scale to run on multiple machines while handling millions of messages a second.\nDistributed data processing applications are hard. We know; over the course of our careers, we’ve been involved in building a lot of them. Here’s a quick checklist of things we’d need to worry about for an application like Market Spread if we were to start from scratch:\n\nCreating a robust communication layer between communicating processes\nEnsuring message replay occurs when a message fails to process.\nEnsuring messages aren’t processed twice on message replay\nEfficient sharding of data across multiple machines\nOptimizing computations for performance\nMinimizing administrative messages\nMinimizing data movement\nHandling message source back-pressure\nMetrics, monitoring, and telemetry\nImplementing our domain logic\n\nThat’s a lot to tackle and a lot of code to introduce bugs in. Wallaroo is, in part, an answer to that problem. It creates a robust platform that handles sharding and partitioning data across many machines. By leveraging Wallaroo, you can build demanding high-performance applications like Market Spread without having to worry about replaying messages when failures occur or deduplicating data on message replay. At-least-once message processing and idempotence come as a core part of the platform. We focus on the hard infrastructure problems, so you don’t have to. By building Market Spread using Wallaroo, the checklist becomes:\n\nImplementing our domain logic\n\nCore Wallaroo abstractions\nHow does one go about building a Wallaroo application? Via our developer framework and its APIs which are the focus of this guide. The core abstractions from our API that we'll touch on in this introduction are:\n\nComputation\nPipeline\nSource\nSink\n\nThe most important of these is a Computation. Computations come in two varieties: stateless and stateful. A stateless computation takes some data as an input and creates some new data as an output. For example, a “double computation” might take in an integer such as 2 and output 4. A stateful computation is similar to a stateless computation except it takes an additional input: the state it will operate on. An example of a stateful computation would be a counter that keeps track of the running total of all numbers it has processed.\nYou can combine computations together using another abstraction we provide: Pipeline. A pipeline allows you to say, for example, that the output from computation A will be processed by computation B. A pipeline begins with a Source step, which is responsible for receiving and decoding incoming external messages. Likewise, the pipeline may end at a Sink, if it has anything to output, which encodes data and sends it to an external receiver. In this way, you can take individual computations and start turning them into applications that take in data from various external sources and ultimately produce outputs that are sent to external systems via sinks.\nMarket Spread in Wallaroo\nGiven these abstractions, what does our Market Spread application look like?\n\nYou can see we end up with two pipelines, one for our NBBO Feed and another for the Order Feed, each with its own corresponding source. We have a single type of state that we are storing (NBBO State by symbol), two stateful computations--one to Update state, another to Check it--and finally a Sink that we send any output to.\nMarket Spread Performance\nWallaroo has been developed to provide correct results quickly. What does quickly mean? Wallaroo is designed to process millions of events on a single machine, with median latencies that are measured in microseconds and tail latencies that are measured in single digit milliseconds. Low latencies are all well and good, but what does that mean in practice?\nPerformance is, in the end, highly dependent on the type of data, the computations being performed, etc.  This guide isn't the place to present detailed benchmarks so let's give a quick idea of what the performance of a Wallaroo application can look like.\nLet’s talk about the aforementioned Market Spread application and some recent performance numbers we’ve gotten with it. First, though, let’s highlight some key points:\n\nThe logic is reasonably straightforward.\nThe state it stores in memory remains constant in size.\nIt has two streams of data, only one of which occasionally produces output that results in network traffic (1 out of 70,000).\nMessages are 50 to 60 bytes in size.\n\nDuring a recent performance testing run using 16 cores on an AWS m4 class machine, we were able to run each stream of data at around 1.5 million messages per second for a total of 3 million messages per second across the two streams. Our processing latencies were:\n\n\n\n\n50%\n95%\n99%\n99.9%\n99.99%\n\n\n\n\n\n66µs\n0.5ms\n0.5ms\n0.5ms\n1 ms\n\n\n\nEven with the application caveats that we laid out, we think that is some pretty impressive performance. Performance that we are committed to maintaining as we continue to add functionality to Wallaroo.\nExactly-once processing\nWe mentioned earlier that our goal is to “provide correct results quickly.\" The \"correct\" part of that statement is the most important part. Processing millions of events a second is only great if the results are accurate. We guarantee accurate results, even in the face of failure, by providing integrated managed state and exactly-once processing.\n\"Exactly-once\" is a bit of a holy grail in distributed systems. As such, it's a heated topic and one that causes confusion. What do we mean when we say that Wallaroo provides \"exactly-once processing\"? In the face of failure, when messages have to be replayed to ensure that no data is lost, we won't process a message more than once. Note that this is very different from saying a message will only be delivered once. If you are a bit lost, don't worry. Hopefully, this example will help.\nImagine a counting application. It takes in numbers and adds their value to its internal state. If we send in the values 5, 10, 15 and it runs without error, we would expect the final value to be 30. Errors do, however, happen. Imagine that we sent in 5 and 10 and then an error occurs. Further, we have only acknowledged that 5 was received and processed. What do we do? If we resend 10 and it was already processed, then our final value will be 40 instead of 30. If we don’t resend and it wasn’t processed, then our final value will be 20 instead of 30.\nWhat we want to do is ensure that each message has been delivered at least once while also ensuring that it is processed only once. In distributed system lingo this is \"at-least-once message delivery\" + \"idempotence\". By combining the two, we can guarantee that results in Wallaroo are correct even in the face of failures.\n"},"book/core-concepts/intro.html":{"url":"book/core-concepts/intro.html","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Core Concepts\nIn this section, we are going to introduce you to the core concepts of Wallaroo that you will be working with when you use our APIs.

A pipeline takes in data from an external system, performs a series of computations based on that data, and optionally produces outputs which are sent to an external system.\nHere is a diagram illustrating a single, linear pipeline:\nExternal   | Wallaroo                     Wallaroo|    External\n System ──>|  Source ─> C1 ─> C2 ─> C3 ─>   Sink  |──>  System\n   A       |                                      |       B\nAn external data source sends data (say, over TCP) to an internal Wallaroo source. The Wallaroo source decodes that stream of bytes, transforming it into a stream of internal data types that are sent to a series of computations (C1, C2, and C3). Each computation takes an input and produces an output. Finally, C3 sends its output to a Wallaroo sink, which encodes that output as a series of bytes and sends it over TCP to an external system.\nA Wallaroo application can have multiple interacting pipelines. For example, an app could have one pipeline that takes data and updates state based on that data, and a second pipeline that takes data, does computations against the current state in the system, and produces output based on the state and data. The first of these has no sink, whereas the second does.\nConcepts\nState\n: Accumulated result of data stored over the course of time\nComputation\n: Code that transforms an input of some type In to\nan output of some type Out (or optionally None if the input should be\nfiltered out).\nState Computation\n: Code that takes an input type In and a state\nobject of some type State, operates on that input and state (possibly\nmaking state updates), and optionally producing an output of some type Out.\nSource\n: Input point for data from external systems into an application.\nSink\n: Output point from an application to external systems.\nDecoder\n: Code that transforms a stream of bytes from an external system\ninto a series of application input types.\nEncoder\n: Code that transforms an application output type into bytes for\nsending to an external system.\nPipeline\n: A sequence of computations and/or state computations originating\nfrom a source and optionally terminating in a sink.\nApplication\n: A collection of pipelines.\nTopology\n: A graph of how all sources, sinks, and computations are\nconnected within an application.\nAPI\nWallaroo provides APIs for implementing all of the above concepts.\n"},"book/core-concepts/state.html":{"url":"book/core-concepts/state.html","title":"State","keywords":"","body":"State\nThe expectation with Wallaroo is that most applications will be stateful. Understanding how Wallaroo handles state is key to being able to design effective Wallaroo applications. In this section, we're going to take you through how state works in Wallaroo and what advantages this brings.\nTransactions in Wallaroo\nTransactions are awesome. Using a data management system that features transactions makes our lives as programmers much easier. Transactions provide certain guarantees about how data will be updated that make it easier to reason about our code, easier to understand what our code will do. This is particularly true when we are talking about concurrent operations.\nIt's often quite easy to understand what our code is doing if we only have a single thread. Everything will happen in a nice linear, serial fashion. Sadly, the world in which our code runs isn't serial, it's concurrent. Many different operations happening at one time. Transactions, in part, allow us to think about how our code is updating data as though the updates were happening one at a time, that is in a serial fashion.\nWallaroo doesn't have transactions in the traditional database sense. However, we do have a means of providing similar guarantees. Wallaroo allows you to atomically update individual bits of state. To understand how that works and the guarantees that Wallaroo provides, let's dig into how Wallaroo handles that.\nWallaroo and State\nThe simplest thing we could do to make it easy to reason about state is to lock all the state in your application. Only allowing a single update or read at a time. It would make Wallaroo applications very easy to reason about. It would also make them incredibly slow.\nWhat we've done instead is to allow you to break your state down into more discrete entities we call \"state objects\". All reads/writes of a given state object are guaranteed to happen in a serial fashion. No more than one thread will ever access a given state object at a time. \nThis makes it easy to reason about state within Wallaroo. All the wonderful reasoning benefits we get from transactions apply in Wallaroo, except that rather than being across an entire database, it's across individual state objects.\nSo what is a state object? Let's explain via an example. Imagine we are writing an application that keeps track of the latest price for different stock in the stock market. Each of the stocks would become a state object. It's the discrete unit of atomicity that we want to be able to safely update. We want to make sure only one thread at a time is updating IBM, but, we also want to go fast, so it's ok if APPL or AMZN is being updated at the same time.\nWallaroo allows you to define your own state objects that match your domain. For example, our example application might define a state object as:\nPythonGoclass Stock(object):\n    def __init__(self, symbol, price):\n        self.symbol = symbol\n        self.price = pricetype Stock struct {\n  Symbol string\n  Price float64\n}\nState objects can be arbitrarily complex. Our example is two fields. If your application required it, you could build a deeply nested series of objects.\nWallaroo, state, and parallelization\nIn our stock market example, we can read from and write to each state object independently. Our state objects are a unit of parallelization. If we have 3,000 different state objects and 3,000 CPUS then we can update all our state objects concurrently. Odds are, we are going to have more state objects than we have CPUs. Wallaroo handles all parallelization and routing of messages to state objects. \nThe Wallaroo API features a concept called a \"partitioning function\" that allows you to examine a message indicate how it should be routed. For example, imagine a message in our stock market application is:\n{\n\"symbol\": \"IBM\",\n\"price\": \"169.53\"\n}\n\nOur partitioning function would take a message as input and return IBM as output. This would, in turn, be used by Wallaroo to route the message.\nConclusion\nWallaroo gives you serialized access to state. by properly partitioning your state along transactional boundaries you can parallelize access to independent pieces of state. Wallaroo takes care of this parallelization for you, all you have to do is give it a function that can tell it which pieces of state should be accessed for a particular message.\n"},"book/core-concepts/working-with-state.html":{"url":"book/core-concepts/working-with-state.html","title":"Working with State","keywords":"","body":"Working with State\nWallaroo's state objects allow developers to define their own domain-specific data structures that Wallaroo manages. These state objects are used to store state in running application. They provide safe, serialized access to data in a highly parallelized environment. In \"Working in State\", we are going to take you through how you can operate on your state objects.\nState computations\nImagine a word counting application. We'll have a state object for each different word. Each word and count object would look something like:\nPythonGoclass WordAndCount(object):\n    def __init__(self, word=\"\", count=0):\n        self.word = word\n        self.count = counttype WordAndCount struct {\n  Word string\n  Count uint64\n}\nState computations allow you to read and write data to state objects. State computations have 2 inputs and 2 outputs. \n\nState computation input:\nThe message to be processed\nThe state object we are operating on\n\n\nState computation output:\nAn optional output message\nA boolean to indicate if we made any updates to the state object we operated on\n\n\n\nThread Safety\nWhen a state computation is running, one of the parameters it is provided is the state to operate on. That state will only be provided to a single state computation at a time. Within the state computation, you don't have to worry about thread synchronization issues. \n"},"book/core-concepts/partitioning.html":{"url":"book/core-concepts/partitioning.html","title":"Partitioning","keywords":"","body":"Partitioning\nIf all of the application state exists in one state object then only one computation at a time can access that state object. In order to leverage concurrency, that state needs to be divided into multiple distinct state objects. Wallaroo can then automatically distribute these objects in a way that allows them to be accessed by computations in parallel.\nFor example, in an application that keeps track of stock prices, the application state might be a dictionary where the stock symbol is used to look up the price of the stock.\nPythonGoclass Stock(object):\n    def __init__(self, symbol, price):\n        self.symbol = symbol\n        self.price = price\n\n\nclass Stocks(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.stocks = {}\n\n    def set(self, symbol, price):\n        stock = self.stocks[symbol]\n        stock.price = price\ntype Stock struct {\n  Symbol string\n  Price float64\n}\n\ntype Stocks struct {\n  Stocks map[string]Stock\n}\n\nfunc (s *Stocks) Set(symbol string, price float64) {\n  stock := s[symbol]\n  stock.Price = price\n}\nIf a message came into the system with a new stock price, the computation would take that message, get the symbol and the price, and use them to update the state.\nPythonGo@wallaroo.state_computation(\"update stock\")\ndef update_stock(stock, state):\n    symbol = stock.symbol\n    price = stock.price\n\n    state.set(symbol, price)\n    return (None, True)\ntype UpdateStock struct {}\n\nfunc (us *UpdateStock) Compute(data interface{}, state interface{}) (interface{}, bool) {\n    stock := data.(*Stock)\n    stocks := state.(*Stocks)\n\n    stocks.Set(stock.Symbol, stock.Price)\n    return nil, true\n}\nHowever, only one computation may access the state at a time, so in this cases messages are handled one at a time.\nIf we could break the state into pieces and tell Wallaroo about those pieces then we could process many messages concurrently. In the example, each stock could be broken out into it's own piece of state. This is possible because in the model the price of each stock is independent of the price of any other stock, so modifying one has no effect on any of the others.\nState Partitioning\nWallaroo supports parallel execution by way of state partitioning. The state is broken up into distinct parts, and Wallaroo manages access to each part so that they can be accessed in parallel.\nTo do this, a partition function is used to determine which state part a particular data should be applied to. Once the part is determined, the data and the associated state part are given to a Computation to perform the update logic.\nPartitioned State\nIn order to take advantage of state partitioning, state objects need to be broken down. In the stock example there is already a class that represents an individual stock, so it can be used as the partitioned state.\nPythonGoclass Stock(object):\n    def __init__(self, symbol, price):\n        self.symbol = symbol\n        self.price = pricetype Stock struct {\n  Symbol string\n  Price float64\n}\nSince the computation only has one stock in its state now, there is no need to do a dictionary look up. Instead, the computation can update the particular Stock's state right away.\nPythonGo@wallaroo.state_computation(name=\"update stock\")\ndef update_stock(stock, state):\n    state.symbol = stock.symbol\n    state.price = stock.price\n\n    return (None, True)\ntype UpdateStock struct {}\n\nfunc (us *UpdateStock) Compute(data interface{}, state interface{}) (interface{}, bool) {\n    stock := data.(*Stock)\n    state := state.(*Stock)\n\n    state.Symbol = stock.Symbol\n    state.Price = stock.Price\n\n    return nil, true\n\nPartition Key\nCurrently, the partition keys for a particular partition need to be defined along with the application. The specific details of keys vary between the different language APIs, but they are typically an object of some type that can support comparison and hashing. In the stock example, the partition key would be based on the symbol name (a string). All of the expected stock symbols are passed to the application setup code.\nPartition Function\nThe partition function takes in message data and returns a partition key. In the example, the message symbol would be extracted from the message data and returned as the key.\nPythonGo@wallaroo.partition\ndef partition(data):\n    return data.symbolfunc symbolToKey(symbol string) uint64 {\n    return uint64(binary.BigEndian.Uint32([]byte(fmt.Sprintf(\"%4s\", symbol))))\n}\n\ntype SymbolPartitionFunction struct {\n}\n\nfunc (spf *SymbolPartitionFunction) Partition(data interface{}) uint64 {\n    symbol := data.(SymbolMessage).GetSymbol()\n    return symbolToKey(symbol)\n}\n"},"book/language_support.html":{"url":"book/language_support.html","title":"Wallaroo Languages Supported","keywords":"","body":"Wallaroo Languages Supported\nWallaroo currently supports the Python and Go programming languages.\n\nLearn more about how to use Wallaroo with Python.\nLearn more about how to use Wallaroo with Go.\n\n"},"book/python/intro.html":{"url":"book/python/intro.html","title":"Wallaroo with Python Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Python API Introduction\nThe Wallaroo Python API can be used to write Wallaroo applications entirely in Python without needing Java or a JVM. This lets developers quickly get started with Wallaroo by leveraging their existing Python knowledge. It currently supports Python 2.7. Support for Python 3.X is in the works and we encourage you to contact us if that is a requirement.\nIn order to write a Wallaroo application in Python, the developer creates classes that provide the methods expected by the API (see Wallaroo Python API Classes for more detail on this) and writes an entry point function that uses the Wallaroo ApplicationBuilder to define the layout of their application.\nFor a basic overview of what Wallaroo does, read What is Wallaroo and Core Concepts. These documents will help you understand the system at a high level so that you can see how the pieces of the Python API fit into it.\nMachida\nMachida is the program that runs Wallaroo applications written using the Wallaroo Python API. It takes a module name as its --application-module argument and requires a method called application_setup(...) to be defined in that module. This method returns the structure describing the Wallaroo application in terms of Python objects, which is then used to coordinate calling those objects’ methods with the appropriate arguments as the application is running.\nMachida runs Wallaroo Python applications using an embedded CPython interpreter. You should be able to use any Python modules that you would normally use when creating a Python application.\nPython Packages\nWallaroo programs that use the Python API can use any packages that would be used with a normal Python program, including your own packages and third party packages. In order to use them, they must be installed on every machine in the Wallaroo cluster and must be accessible via the PYTHONPATH.\nWe recommend using virtualenv with Wallaroo.

This setting is optional but makes it easier to reference the container in later commands.\n\n\nTerminal 2, Start the Metrics UI\nEnter the Wallaroo Docker container:\ndocker exec -it wally env-setup\n\nThis command will start a new Bash shell within the container, which will run the env-setup script to ensure our persistent Python virtualenv is set up.\nTo start the Metrics UI run:\nmetrics_reporter_ui start\n\nYou can verify it started up correctly by visiting http://localhost:4000.\nIf you need to restart the UI, run:\nmetrics_reporter_ui restart\n\nWhen it's time to stop the UI, run:\nmetrics_reporter_ui stop\n\nIf you need to start the UI after stopping it, run:\nmetrics_reporter_ui start\n\nTerminal 3, Run Giles Receiver\nEnter the Wallaroo Docker container:\ndocker exec -it wally env-setup\n\nWe'll use Giles Receiver to listen for data from our Wallaroo application.\nreceiver --listen 127.0.0.1:5555 --no-write --ponythreads=1 --ponynoblock\n\nYou should see the line Listening for data that indicates that Giles receiver is running.\nTerminal 4, Run the \"Celsius to Fahrenheit\" Application\nEnter the Wallaroo Docker container:\ndocker exec -it wally env-setup\n\nFirst, we'll need to get to the python Celsius example directory with the following command:\ncd /src/wallaroo/examples/python/celsius\n\nNow that we are in the proper directory, and the Metrics UI and a data receiver are up and running, we can run the application itself by executing the following command:\nmachida --application-module celsius --in 127.0.0.1:7000 \\\n  --out 127.0.0.1:5555 --metrics 127.0.0.1:5001 --control 127.0.0.1:6000 \\\n  --data 127.0.0.1:6001 --name worker-name --external 127.0.0.1:5050 \\\n  --cluster-initializer --ponythreads=1 --ponynoblock\n\nThis tells the \"Celsius to Fahrenheit\" application that it should listen on port 7000 for incoming data, write outgoing data to port 5555, and send metrics data to port 5001.\nTerminal 5, Sending Data\nEnter the Wallaroo Docker container:\ndocker exec -it wally env-setup\n\nWe will be sending in 25,000,000 messages using a pre-generated data file. The data file will be repeatedly sent via Giles Sender until we reach 25,000,000 messages.\nYou will now be able to start the sender with the following command:\nsender --host 127.0.0.1:7000 --messages 25000000 --binary \\\n--batch-size 50 --interval 10_000_000 --repeat --no-write \\\n--msg-size 8 --ponythreads=1 --ponynoblock \\\n  --file /src/wallaroo/examples/python/celsius/celsius.msg\n\nIf the sender is working correctly, you should see Connected printed to the screen. If you see that, you can be assured that we are now sending data into our example application.\nCheck Out Some Metrics\nFirst Look\nOnce the sender has successfully connected, if you visit the Metrics UI the landing page should show you that the \"Celsius to Fahrenheit\" application has successfully connected.\n\nIf your landing page resembles the one above, the \"Celsius to Fahrenheit\" application has successfully connected to the Metrics UI.\nNow, let's have a look at some metrics. By clicking on the \"Celsius to Fahrenheit\" link, you'll be taken to the \"Application Dashboard\" page. On this page you should see metric stats for the following:\n\na single pipeline: Celsius Conversion\na single worker: Initializer\nthree computations: Add32, Decode Time in TCP Source, Multiply by 1.8\n\n\nYou'll see the metric stats update as data continues to be processed in our application.\nYou can then click into one of the elements within a category, to get to a detailed metrics page for that element.

So when machida --application-module my_application is run, machida (the binary we previously compiled), loads up the my_application.py module inside of its embedded Python runtime and executes its application_setup() function to retrieve the application topology it needs to construct in order to run the application.\nGenerally, in order to build a Wallaroo Python application, the following steps should be followed:\n\nBuild the machida binary (this only needs to be done once)\nimport wallaroo in the Python application's .py file\nCreate classes that provide the correct Wallaroo Python interfaces (more on this later)\nDefine an application_setup function that uses the ApplicationBuilder from the wallaroo module to construct the application topology.\nRun machida with the application module as the --application-module argument\n\nOnce loaded, Wallaroo executes application_setup(), constructs the appropriate topology, and enters a ready state where it awaits incoming data to process.\nA Note About PYTHONPATH\nMachida uses the PYTHONPATH environment variable to find modules that are imported by the application. You will have at least two modules in your PYTHONPATH: the application module and the wallaroo module. For example, if you have followed the directions for setting up the tutorial then the Wallaroo Python module is in $HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/machida/wallaroo.py and the \"Celsius to Farenheit\" application module is in $HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/examples/python/celsius/celsius.py, so you would export PYTHONPATH like this:\nexport PYTHONPATH=\"$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/machida:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/examples/python/celsius\"\n\nIf you are working your way through the tutorial you might find it easier to set up PYTHONPATH to use whatever directory you are in as the search path so that you can run the application that is the current directory. To do this, you would export PYTHONPATH like this:\nexport PYTHONPATH=\"$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/machida:.\"\n\nIf you chose to do this while working through the tutorial, you might also find it useful to add the path to the machida executable to your PATH, which can be done like this:\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/machida/build\"\n\nNext Steps\nTo try running an example, go to the Reverse example application and follow its instructions.\nTo learn how to write your own Wallaroo Python application, continue to Writing Your Own Application\nTo find out more detail on the command line arguments and other aspects of running Wallaroo application, see the Running Wallaroo section.\n"},"book/python/writing-your-own-application.html":{"url":"book/python/writing-your-own-application.html","title":"Writing Your Own Application","keywords":"","body":"Writing Your Own Wallaroo Python Application\nIn this section, we will go over the components that are required in order to write a Wallaroo Python application. We will start with the stateless reverse.py application from the examples section, then move on to an application that maintains and modifies state and, finally, a stateful application that also uses partitioning to divide its work.\nA Stateless Application - Reverse Words\nThe reverse.py application is going to receive text as its input, reverse it, and then send out the reversed text to its sink. In order to do this, our application needs to provide the following functions:\n\nInput decoding - how to translate the incoming bytestream into a Python string\nComputation - this is where the input string is going to get reversed\nOutput encoding - how to construct and format the bytestream that will be sent out by the sink\n\nComputation\nLet's start with the computation, because that's the purpose of the application:\n@wallaroo.computation(name='reverse'):\ndef reverse(self, data):\n    print \"compute\", data\n    return data[::-1]\n\nA Computation has no state, so it only needs to define its name, and how to convert input data into output data. In this case, string reversal is performed with a slice notation.\nNote that there is a print statement in the compute method (and in other methods in this document). They are here to help show the user what is happening at different points as the application executes. This is only for demonstration purposes and is not recommended in actual applications.\nSink Encoder\nNext, we are going to define how the output gets constructed for the sink. It is important to remember that Wallaroo sends its output over the network, so data going through the sink needs to be of type bytes. In Python2, this is the same as str.\n@wallaroo.encoder\ndef encode(self, data):\n    # data is a string\n    print \"encode\", data\n    return data + \"\\n\"\n\nSourceDecoder\nNow, we also need to decode the incoming bytes of the source.\n@wallaroo.decoder(header_length=4, length_fmt=\">I\")\ndef decode(self, bs):\n    print \"decode\", bs\n    return bs.decode(\"utf-8\")\n\nThis one is different. When using a TCP source, Wallaroo handles streams of bytes, and in order to do that efficiently, it uses a method called message framing. This means that Wallaroo requires input data to follow a special structure, as well as for the application to provide the mechanism with which to decode this data.\nTo read more about this, please refer to the Creating A Decoder section.\nFor our application purposes, we will simply define the structure and how it is going to get parsed:\n\nInput messages have the following structure: A fixed length PAYLOAD_SIZE followed by PAYLOAD\nWallaroo requires three methods to parse this type of message:\nheader_length(), which returns the number of bytes used for the PAYLOAD_SIZE in the message. This value tells Wallaroo how many bytes to read from the stream as HEADER.\npayload_length(bs), which reads PAYLOAD_SIZE bytestring of the size returned by header_length() and computes the size of PAYLOAD. It then returns that size as an integer to Wallaroo, which will then read that many bytes from the stream.\ndecode(bs), which receives the remainder of the message, MSG, and decodes it into a python object.\n\n\n\nIn our case:\n\nPAYLOAD_SIZE is a big-endian unsigned 32-bit integer, so we return 4 from header_length() and use struct.unpack('>I', bs) to read it as an integer.\nPAYLOAD is text, so we decode as such, using 'utf-8' encoding.\n\nApplication Setup\nSo now that we have input decoding, computation, and output decoding defined, how do we build it all into an application?\nFor this, two things are needed:\n\nAn entry point for Wallaroo to create the application. This is the function application_setup that you need to define.\nThe actual topology application_setup is going to return for Wallaroo to create the application.\n\nApplication Builder and Pipelines\nAn application is constructed of pipelines which, in turn, are constructed from a sequence of a source, steps, and optionally a sink. Our reverse application only has one pipeline, so we only need to create one:\nab = wallaroo.ApplicationBuilder(\"Reverse Word\")\nab.new_pipeline(\"reverse\",\n                wallaroo.TCPSourceConfig(in_host, in_port, decoder))\n\nEach pipeline must have a source, and each source must have a decoder, so new_pipeline takes a name and a TCPSourceConfig instance as its arguments.\nNext, we add the computation step:\nab.to(reverse)\n\nAnd finally, we add the sink, using a TCPSinkConfig:\nab.to_sink(wallaroo.TCPSinkConfig(\"localhost\", \"7010\", encoder))\n\nThe application_setup Entry Point\nAfter Wallaroo has loaded the application's python file, it will try to execute its application_setup() function. This function is where the application builder steps from above are going to run.\ndef application_setup(args):\n    in_host, in_port = wallaroo.tcp_parse_input_addrs(args)[0]\n    out_host, out_port = wallaroo.tcp_parse_output_addrs(args)[0]\n\n    ab = wallaroo.ApplicationBuilder(\"Reverse Word\")\n    ab.new_pipeline(\"reverse\",\n                    wallaroo.TCPSourceConfig(in_host, in_port, decoder))\n    ab.to(reverse)\n    ab.to_sink(wallaroo.TCPSinkConfig(out_host, out_port, encoder))\n    return ab.build()\n\nConfiguration objects are used to pass information about sources and sinks to the application builder. Currently the only supported source and sink types are TCP and Kafka.\nWallaroo provides convenience the functions tcp_parse_input_addrs and tcp_parse_output_addrs to parse host and port information that is passed on the command line, or the user can supply their own code for getting these values. When using the convenience functions, host/port pairs are represented on the command line as colon-separated values and multiple host/port values are represented by a comma-separated list of host/port values. The functions assume that --in is used for input addresses, and --out is used for output addresses. For example, this set of command line arguments would specify two input host/port values and one output:\n--in localhost:7001,localhost:7002 --out localhost:7010\nMiscellaneous\nOf course, no Python module is complete without its imports. In this case, only two imports are required:\nimport struct\nimport wallaroo\n\nRunning reverse.py\nThe complete example is available here.

If you haven't reviewed the simple stateless application example yet, you may find it here.\nA Stateful Application - Alphabet\nOur stateful application is going to be a vote counter, called Alphabet. It receives as its input a message containing an alphabet character and a number of votes, which it then increments in its internal state. After each update, it sends the new updated vote count of that character to its output.\nAs with the Reverse Word example, we will list the components required:\n\nInput decoding\nOutput encoding\nComputation for adding votes\nState objects\nState change management\n\nComputation\nThe computation here is fairly straightforward: given a data object and a state object, update the state with the new data, and return some data that tells Wallaroo what to do next.\n@wallaroo.state_computation(name='add votes')\ndef add_votes(self, data, state):\n    state.update(data)\n    return (state.get_votes(data.letter), True)\n\nLet's dig into that tuple that we are returning:\n(state.get_votes(data.letter), True)\n\nThe first element, state.get_votes(data.letter) is a message that we will send on to our next step. In this case, we will be sending information about votes for this letter on to a sink. The second element. True is a to let Wallaroo know if we should store an update for our state. By returning true, we are instructing to Wallaroo to save our updated state so that in the event of a crash, we can recover to this point. Being able to recover from a crash is a good thing so, why wouldn't we always return True? There are two answers:\n\nYour computation might not have updated the state, in which case, saving its state for recovery is wasteful.\nYou might only want to save after some changes. Saving your state can be expensive for large objects. There's a tradeoff that can be made between performance and safety.\n\nState and StateBuilder\nThe state for this application is two-tiered. There is a vote count for each letter:\nclass Votes(object):\n    def __init__(self, letter, votes):\n        self.letter = letter\n        self.votes = votes\n\nAnd a state map:\nclass AllVotes(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.votes_by_letter = {}\n\n    def update(self, votes):\n        letter = votes.letter\n        vote_count = votes.votes\n\n        votes_for_letter = self.votes_by_letter.get(letter, Votes(letter, 0))\n        votes_for_letter.votes += vote_count\n        self.votes_by_letter[letter] = votes_for_letter\n\n    def get_votes(self, letter):\n        vbl = self.votes_by_letter[letter]\n        return Votes(letter, vbl.votes)\n\nThis map is the state object that AddVotes.compute above takes.\nAn important thing to note here is that get_votes returns a new Votes instance. This is important, as this is the value that is returned eventually passed to Encoder.encode, and if we passed a reference to a mutable object here, there is no guarantee that Encoder.encode will execute before another update to this object.\nEncoder\nThe encoder is going to receive a Votes instance and encode into a string with the letter, followed by the vote count as a big-endian 64-bit unsigned integer:\n@wallaroo.encoder\ndef encode(self, data):\n    # data is a Votes\n    return struct.pack(\">IsQ\", 9, data.letter, data.votes)\n\nDecoder\nThe decoder, like the one in Reverse Word, is going to use a header_length of 4 bytes to denote a big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer. Then, for the data, it is expecting a single character followed by a big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer. Here we use the struct module to unpack these integers from the bytes string.\n@wallaroo.decoder(header_length=4, length_fmt=\">I\")\ndef decode(self, bs):\n    (letter, vote_count) = struct.unpack(\">sI\", bs)\n    return Votes(letter, vote_count)\n\nApplication Setup\nFinally, let's set up our application topology:\ndef application_setup(args):\n    in_host, in_port = wallaroo.tcp_parse_input_addrs(args)[0]\n    out_host, out_port = wallaroo.tcp_parse_output_addrs(args)[0]\n\n    ab = wallaroo.ApplicationBuilder(\"alphabet\")\n    ab.new_pipeline(\"alphabet\",\n                    wallaroo.TCPSourceConfig(in_host, in_port, decoder))\n    ab.to_stateful(add_votes, AllVotes, \"letter state\")\n    ab.to_sink(wallaroo.TCPSinkConfig(out_host, out_port, encoder))\n    return ab.build()\n\nThe only difference between this setup and the stateless Reverse Word's one is that while in Reverse Word we used:\nab.to(reverse)\n\nhere we use:\nab.to_stateful(add_votes, AllVotes, \"letter state\")\n\nThat is, while the stateless computation constructor to took only a computation class as its argument, the stateful computation constructor to_stateful takes a computation function, as well as a state class, along with the name of that state.\nMiscellaneous\nThis module needs its imports:\nimport struct\nimport pickle\n\nimport wallaroo\n\nNext Steps\nThe complete alphabet example is available here.

If you haven't reviewed the simple state application and simple stateful application examples, you can find them here and here.\nPartitioning\nPartitioning is a key aspect of how work is distributed in Wallaroo. From the application's point of view, what is required are:\n\na list of partition keys\na partitioning function\npartition-compatible states - the state should be defined in such a way that each partition can have its own distinct state instance\n\nA Partitioned Stateful Application - Alphabet (partitioned)\nOur partitioned application is going to be very similar to the Alphabet application. The difference is that it is going to use partitioning to distribute the work, and the state classes will need to reflect that.\nEncode, Decode, Computation, and Votes are exactly the same as before, so we will not include them here.\nPartition\nIf we were to use partitioning in the alphabet application from the previous section, and we wanted to partition by key, then one way we could go about it is:\nCreate a partition key list:\nletter_partitions = list(string.ascii_lowercase)\n\nAnd then a partitioning function which returns a key from the above list for input data:\nclass LetterPartitionFunction(object):\n    def partition(self, data):\n        return data.letter[0]\n\nLater when we build the application topology, we will pass both the keys and the function to the builder.\nState and StateBuilder\nPreviously we had a state map called AllVotes that kept a dict of votes by letter:\nclass AllVotes(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.votes_by_letter = {}\n\nBut since we are going to partition by letter, there is no reason to keep this structure. Instead, we will store the votes for a single letter in each state:\nclass TotalVotes(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.letter = 'X'\n        self.votes = 0\n\n    def update(self, votes):\n        self.letter = votes.letter\n        self.votes += votes.votes\n\n    def get_votes(self):\n        return Votes(self.letter, self.votes)\n\nAnd since we changed the name of the state class from AllVotes to TotalVotes, the State Builder needs to be updated to reflect this:\nclass LetterStateBuilder(object):\n    def name(self):\n        return \"Letter State Builder\"\n\n    def build(self):\n        return TotalVotes()\n\nApplication Setup\nFinally, the application setup is a little different now that we use partitioning. A partition is an intrinsic part of a pipeline's definition, as it changes how Wallaroo connects elements behind the scenes, so we have to distinguish partitioned state from non-partitioned state. This is done with to_state_partition and to_state_partition_u64 respectively (compared with to_stateful in the non-partitioned case, as in the previous section).\nAs with to_stateful, to_state_partition takes a Computation, a StateBuilder, and a state name. In addition, it takes a partition function and a partition keys list:\nab.to_state_partition(AddVotes(), LetterStateBuilder(), \"letter state\",\n                      LetterPartitionFunction(), letter_partitions)\n\nSo the new application_setup is going to look like\ndef application_setup(args):\n    in_host, in_port = wallaroo.tcp_parse_input_addrs(args)[0]\n    out_host, out_port = wallaroo.tcp_parse_output_addrs(args)[0]\n\n    letter_partitions = list(string.ascii_lowercase)\n    ab = wallaroo.ApplicationBuilder(\"alphabet\")\n    ab.new_pipeline(\"alphabet\",\n                    wallaroo.TCPSourceConfig(in_host, in_port, Decoder()))\n    ab.to_state_partition(AddVotes(), LetterStateBuilder(), \"letter state\",\n                          LetterPartitionFunction(), letter_partitions)\n    ab.to_sink(wallaroo.TCPSinkConfig(out_host, out_port, Encoder()))\n    return ab.build()\n\nMiscellaneous\nThe imports used in this module are\nimport string\nimport struct\nimport wallaroo\n\nNext Steps\nThe complete alphabet example is available here.

It's canonical not because everyone needs to count words but because it's a good platform for demonstrating how to do many of the everyday tasks in a streaming application.\nThis section will take you through our Wallaroo word count example. Along the way, we will introduce you to a couple of new concepts: parallelizing stateless computations, and splitting one incoming message into several outgoing ones.\nWord count\nOur word counting application receives text input in the form of chunks of text. It then splits those chunks into lines and from there into individual words. We then send those words to a stateful partition where we increment the running count and finally, after updating, send as output the word and its current count.\nApplication Setup\nLet's dive in and take a look at our application setup:\ndef application_setup(args):\n    in_host, in_port = wallaroo.tcp_parse_input_addrs(args)[0]\n    out_host, out_port = wallaroo.tcp_parse_output_addrs(args)[0]\n\n    word_partitions = list(string.ascii_lowercase)\n    word_partitions.append(\"!\")\n\n    ab = wallaroo.ApplicationBuilder(\"Word Count Application\")\n    ab.new_pipeline(\"Split and Count\",\n                    wallaroo.TCPSourceConfig(in_host, in_port, decoder))\n    ab.to_parallel(split)\n    ab.to_state_partition(count_word, WordTotals, \"word totals\",\n        partition, word_partitions)\n    ab.to_sink(wallaroo.TCPSinkConfig(out_host, out_port, encoder))\n    return ab.build()\n\nBy now, hopefully, most of this looks somewhat familiar. We're building on concepts we've seen in our previous example applications. We set up a new application with a single pipeline:\nab = wallaroo.ApplicationBuilder(\"Word Count Application\")\nab.new_pipeline(\"Split and Count\",\n                wallaroo.TCPSourceConfig(in_host, in_port, decoder))\n\nUpon receiving some textual input, our word count application will route it to a stateless computation called split. split is responsible for breaking the text down into individual words. You might notice something a little different about how we set up this stateful computation. In our previous example, we called to on our application builder. In this case, we are calling to_parallel. What's the difference between to and to_parallel? The to method creates a single instance of the stateless computation. No matter how many workers we might run in our Wallaroo cluster, there will only be a single instance of the computation. Every message that is processed by the computation will need to be routed the worker running that computation. to_parallel is different. By doing to_parallel(split), we are placing the split computation on every worker in our cluster.\nA to vs to_parallel digression\nParallelizing a stateless computation seems like something you'd always want to do. So why does to exist? Message ordering. Some applications require that all incoming messages maintain ordering. Some don't. If we don't care about message order, we probably want to use to_parallel.\nImagine that our word splitting application has the following two blocks of text arrive:\nBLOCK 1:\n\nHello there, how are you?\n\nBLOCK 2:\n\nFred needs help.\n\nIn the case of word count, it doesn't matter what order we count the messages. We just want to do it quickly. to_parallel is our friend. However, if all words starting with the letter \"h\" were going to be sent along to the same computation after splitting and the order they arrived was important than to_parallel would not be our friend. If the computation that deals with the letter \"h\" needs to see \"Hello\" then \"how\" and then \"help\", you have to use to. It will maintain ordering by processing the incoming blocks sequentially rather than in parallel.\nIn our current case, counting words, we don't care about the order of the words, so to_parallel is fine.\nApplication setup, the return\nBack to our application setup\ndef application_setup(args):\n    in_host, in_port = wallaroo.tcp_parse_input_addrs(args)[0]\n    out_host, out_port = wallaroo.tcp_parse_output_addrs(args)[0]\n\n    word_partitions = list(string.ascii_lowercase)\n    word_partitions.append(\"!\")\n\n    ab = wallaroo.ApplicationBuilder(\"Word Count Application\")\n    ab.new_pipeline(\"Split and Count\",\n                    wallaroo.TCPSourceConfig(in_host, in_port, decoder))\n    ab.to_parallel(split)\n    ab.to_state_partition(count_word, WordTotals, \"word totals\",\n        partition, word_partitions)\n    ab.to_sink(wallaroo.TCPSinkConfig(out_host, out_port, encoder))\n    return ab.build()\n\nBeyond to_parallel, there's nothing new in our word count application. After we split our text chunks into words, they get routed to a state partition where they are counted.\n    ab.to_state_partition(count_word, WordTotals, \"word totals\",\n        partition, word_partitions)\n\nNote we setup up 27 partitions to count our words, one for each letter plus one called \"!\" which will handle any \"word\" that doesn't start with a letter:\nword_partitions = list(string.ascii_lowercase)\nword_partitions.append(\"!\")\n\n...\n\nab.to_state_partition(count_word, WordTotals, \"word totals\",\n    partition, word_partitions)\n\nSplitting words\nOur word splitting is mostly uninteresting, except for one huge difference, our previous examples had one output for each input. When splitting text into words, we take one input and produce multiple outputs. Let's see how that is done.\n@wallaroo.computation_multi(name=\"split into words\")\ndef split(data):\n    punctuation = \" !\\\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;?@[\\]^_`{|}~\"\n\n    words = []\n\n    for line in data.split(\"\\n\"):\n        clean_line = line.lower().strip(punctuation)\n        for word in clean_line.split(' '):\n            clean_word = word.strip(punctuation)\n            words.append(clean_word)\n\n    return words\n\nDid you catch what is going on? Previously, we've seen our stateless computations wrapped by the computation decorator. Why do we have both computation and computation_multi? The answer lies in Python's type system.\ncomputation vs computation_multi\nWallaroo's Python API allows a programmer to indicate that the output of a computation is meant to be treated as a single output by using the compute method. This allows us, for example, to split some text into words and have that list of words treated as a single item by Wallaroo. In our word splitting case, that isn't what we want. We want each word to be handled individually. compute_multi lets us tell Wallaroo that each of these words is a new message and should be handled individually.\nBy using computation_multi, each word will be handled individually. This allows us to then route each one based on its first letter for counting. If you look below, you can see that our word partitioning function is expecting words, not a list, which makes sense.\n@wallaroo.partition\ndef partition(data):\n    if data[0] >= 'a' or data[0] \nOur counting guts\nThe next three classes are the core of our word counting application. By this point, our messages has been split into individual words and run through our partition function and will arrive at a state computation based on the first letter of the word.\nLet's take a look at we have. CountWord is a State Computation. When it's run, we update our word_totals state to reflect the new incoming word. Then, it returns a tuple of the return value from word_totals.get_count and True. The return value of get_count is an instance of the WordCount class containing the word and its current count.\n@wallaroo.state_computation(name=\"Count Word\")\ndef count_word(word, word_totals):\n    word_totals.update(word)\n    return (word_totals.get_count(word), True)\n\n\nclass WordCount(object):\n    def __init__(self, word, count):\n        self.word = word\n        self.count = count\n\nWordTotals isn't all that interesting. When we update, we check to see if we have seen the word before and if not, add it to our map of words and set the count to one. If we have seen the word before, we increment its count. get_count looks up a word and returns a WordCount for it.\nclass WordTotals(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.word_totals = {}\n\n    def update(self, word):\n        if self.word_totals.has_key(word):\n            self.word_totals[word] = self.word_totals[word] + 1\n        else:\n            self.word_totals[word] = 1\n\n    def get_count(self, word):\n        return WordCount(word, self.word_totals[word])\n\nHello world! I'm a WordCount.\nBy this point, our word has almost made it to the end of the pipeline. The only thing left is the sink and encoding. We don't do anything fancy with our encoding. We take the word and its count, and we format it into a single line of text that our receiver can record.\n@wallaroo.encoder\ndef encoder(data):\n    return data.word + \" => \" + str(data.count) + \"\\n\"\n\nRunning word_count.py\nThe complete example is available here.

Worker processes send each other encoded objects, some of which may contain Python objects. In order to make this work, the application developer must provide functions called serialize and deserialize that convert between objects and strings that represent those objects.\nWallaroo applications can be made resilient by persisting their state to disk so that if they crash they can recover their state. The resilience system uses the same mechanism that is used for interworker serialization.\nSerialization\nSerialization is the process of creating a string of bytes that represents an object that will be sent to another worker. The application developer must provide a function called serialize(obj) that takes the object to be serialized as its argument and returns a string that represents that object.\nPython's built-in pickle module can take an object and return a string representation of it. If pickle is sufficient for your needs then the serialize function can be implemented as:\ndef serialize(obj):\n    return pickle.dumps(obj)\n\nDeserialization\nDeserialization is the other side of serialization, taking a string of bytes that represents an object and returning the object. The application developer must provide a function called deserialize(s) that takes the string representation of the object and returns the object. If the object was serialized with the pickle module as in the example above then the deserialize method can be implemented as:\ndef deserialize(s):\n    return pickle.loads(s)\n\nA Note About Serializable Objects\nThere are a number of Python packages that can serialize and deserialize Python objects (by default Wallaroo uses pickle). You can also design and implement your own serialization protocol if you feel that you have specific needs that are not met by existing systems. Whatever you do, you must make sure that all of your objects can be serialized and deserialized with the system that you are using. For example, if your application sends message data that contains objects created by third party libraries, you should make sure that those objects can be serialized. Some Python packages provide wrappers around C data, which cannot be serialized using pickle, so if you need to send this type of data then you will have to provide another way to serialize it.\n"},"book/python/api.html":{"url":"book/python/api.html","title":"Wallaroo Python API","keywords":"","body":"Wallaroo Python API Classes\nThe Wallaroo Python API allows developers to create Wallaroo applications in Python, which can then be run by Machida.\nOverview\nIn order to create a Wallaroo application in Python, developers need to create functions and classes that provide the required interfaces for each step in their pipline, and then connect them together in a topology structure that is returned by the entry-point function application_setup.\nThe recommended way to create your topology structure is by using the ApplicationBuilder in the wallaroo module.\nTable of Contents\n\nApplication setup\nApplicationBuilder\nComputation\nData\nKey\nPartitionFunction\nTCPSinkEncoder\nTCPSourceDecoder\nKafkaSinkEncoder\nkafkaSourceDecoder\nState\nStateComputation\nTCPSourceConfig\nTCPSinkConfig\n\nApplication Setup\nAfter Machida has loaded a Wallaroo Python application module, it executes its entry point function: application_setup(args), which returns an application topology structure that tells Wallaroo how to connect the classes, functions, and objects behind the scenes.

This is the topology structure Wallaroo requries in order to construct the topology connectinng all of the application components.\nComputation\nA stateless computation is a simple function that takes input, returns an output, and does not modify any variables outside of its scope. e.g. a stateless computation has no side effects.\nA computation class must be wrapped by the @computation(name) decorator, which takes the name of the computation as an argument.\ncompute(data)\nUse data to perform a computation and return a new output. data is the python object the previous step in the pipeline returned.\ncompute_multi(data)\nUse data to perform a computation and return a series of new outputs. data is the python object the previous step in the pipeline returned. Output is a list of items. Used to turn 1 incoming object into many outgoing objects. Each item in the list will arrive individually at the next step; i.e. not as a list.\nExample Computations\nA Computation that doubles an integer, or returns 0 if its input was not an int:\n@computation(\"double\")\ndef compute(data):\n    if isinstance(data, int):\n        return data*2\n    else\n        return 0\n\nA Computation that returns both its input integer and double that value. If the incoming data isn't an integer, we filter aka drop the message by returning None.\n@computation_multi(\"doubledouble\"):\ndef compute_multi(data):\n    if isinstance(data, int):\n        return [data, data*2]\n    else\n        return None\n\nData\nData is the object that is passed to a Computation and a StateComputation's method. It is a plain Python object and can be as simple or as complex as you would like it to be.\nIt is important to ensure that data returned is always immutable or unique to avoid any unexpected behvaiour due to the asynchronous execution nature of Wallaroo.\nKey\nPartition Keys must correctly support the __eq__ (==) and __hash__ operators. Some built-in types, such as strings and numbers, already support these out of the box. If you are defining your own types, however, you must also implement the __eq__ and __hash__ methods.\nPartitionFunction\nA partition function class must be wrapped in the @partition_function decorator and  return the appropriate Key for data.\nExample PartitionFunction\nAn example that partitions words for a word-count based on their first character, and buckets all other cases to the empty string key\n@partition_function\ndef partition(self, data):\n    try:\n        return data[0].lower() if data[0].isalpha() else ''\n    except:\n        return ''\n\nTCP Sink Encoder\nThe TCP Sink Encoder is responsible for taking the output of the last computation in a pipeline and converting it into a bytes for Wallaroo to send out over a TCP connection.\nTo do this, wrap your function in the @encode decorator.\nencode(data)\nReturn a bytes that can be sent over the network. It is up to the developer to determine how to translate data into a bytes, and what information to keep or discard.\nExample TCPSinkEncoder\nA complete TCPSinkEncoder example that takes a list of integers and encodes it to a sequence of big-endian Longs preceded by a big-endian short representing the number of integers in the list:\n@encoder\ndef encode(self, data):\n    fmt = '>H{}'.format('L'*len(data))\n    return struct.pack(fmt, len(data), *data)\n\nTCP Source Decoder\nThe TCP Source Decoder is responsible for two tasks:\n\nTelling Wallaroo how many bytes to read from its input connection.\nConverting those bytes into an object that the rest of the application can process.\n\nTo do this, wrap your function with the @decoder(header_length, fmt) decorator.\nheader_length\nAn integer representing the number of bytes from the beginning of an incoming message to return to the function that reads the payload length.\nfmt\nA format string that represents how the message header is encoded. A common encoding used in Wallaroo is a big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer, which can be decoded with the struct module's help:\nstruct.unpack('>L', bs)\n\ndecode(bs)\nReturn a python a python object of the type the next step in the pipeline expects.\nbs is a bytes of the length returned by payload_length), and it is up to the developer to translate that into a python object.\nExample TCPSourceDecoder\nA complete TCPSourceDecoder example that decodes messages with a 32-bit unsigned integer payload_length and a character followed by a 32-bt unsigned int in its payload:\n@decoder(header_length=4, length_fmt=\">L\")\ndef decode(self, bs):\n    return struct.unpack('>1sL', bs)\n\nKafka Sink Encoder\nThe Kafka Sink Encoder is responsible for taking the output of the last computation in a pipeline and converting it into a bytes for Wallaroo to send out to a Kafka sink, along with a key or None.\nTo do this, create an encoder function, in the same way you would for a TCP Sink Encoder, but Return a tuple of (bytes, key) that can be sent over the network. It is up to the developer to determine how to translate data into a bytes and key, and what information to keep or discard.\nExample KafkaSinkEncoder\nA complete KafkaSinkEncoder example that takes a word and sends it to the partition corresponding to the first letter of the word:\n@encoder\ndef encode(self, data):\n    word = data[:]\n    letter_key = data[0]\n    return (word, letter_key)\n\nKafka Source Decoder\nThe Kafka Source Decoder is responsible for converting bytes into an object that the rest of the application can process. To do this, create a decoder function, in the same way you would for a TCP Source Decoder.\ndecode(data)\nReturn Python object of the type the next step in the pipeline expects.\ndata is a bytes object representing the incoming Kafka message, and it is up to the developer to translate that into a Python object.\nExample Kafka Source Decoder\nA complete Kafka Source Decoder example that decodes messages with a 32-bit unsigned int in its payload:\n@decoder(header_length=4, length_fmt=\">L\")\ndef decode(self, bs):\n    return struct.unpack('>1sL', bs)\n\nState\nState is an object that is passed to the StateCompution's compute method. It is a plain Python object and can be as simple or as complex as you would like it to. The class definition must be wrapped in the @state decorator.\nA common issue that arises with asynchronous execution, is that when references to mutable objects are passed to the next step, if another update to the state precedes the execution of the next step, it will then execute with the latest state (that is, it will execute with the \"wrong\" state). Therefore, anything returned by a Computation or StateComputation ought to be either unique, or immutable.\nIn either case, it is up to the developer to provide a side-effect safe value for the Computation to return!\nExample State\nAn AlphabetCounts keeps a count for how many times each letter in the English alphabet has been seen\nimport copy\n\n@state\nAlphabetCounts(objects):\n    def __init__(self, initial_counts):\n        self.data = dict(initial_counts)\n\n    def update(self, c, value):\n        self.data[c] += value\n        return self.data[c]\n\n    def get_counts(self):\n        # Return a deep copy of the data dict\n        return copy.deepcopy(self.data)\n\n    def get_count(self, c):\n        # int is safe to return as is!\n        return self.data[c]\n\nStateComputation\nA State Computation is similar to a Computation, except that it takes an additional argument: state.\nIn order to provide resilience, Wallaroo needs to keep track of state changes, or side effects, and it does so by making state an explicit object that is given as input to any StateComputation step.\nSimilarly to a Computation, a StateComputation class must be wrapped in the @state_computation decorator.\ncompute(data, state)\ndata is anything that was returned by the previous step in the pipeline, and state is the State that was defined for this step in the pipeline definition.\nReturns a tuple. The first element is a message that we will send on to our next step. It should be a new object. Returning None will stop processing and no messages will be sent to the next step. The second element is a boolean value instructing Wallaroo to save our updated state so that in the event of a crash, we can recover to this point. Return True to save state. Return False to not save state.\nWhy wouldn't we always return True? There are two answers:\n\nYour computation might not have updated the state, in which case, saving its state for recovery is wasteful.\nYou might only want to save after some changes. Saving your state can be expensive for large objects. There's a tradeoff that can be made between performance and safety.\n\ncompute_multi(data, state)\nSame as compute but the first element of the return tuple is a list of messages to send on to our next step. Allows taking a single input message and creating multiple outputs. Each item in the list will arrive individually at the next step; i.e. not as a list. Wrap this function in @state_computation_multi.\nExample StateComputation\nAn example StateComputation that keeps track of the maximum integer value it has seen so far:\n@state_computation(name='max'):\ndef compute(self, data, state):\n    try:\n        state.update(data)\n    except TypeError:\n        pass\n    return (state.get_max(), True)\n\nTCPSourceConfig\nA TCPSourceConfig object specifies the host, port, and encoder to use for a TCP source connection when creating an application. The host and port are both represented by strings. This object is provided as an argument to new_pipeline.\nTCPSinkConfig\nA TCPSinkConfig object specifies the host, port, and decoder to use for the TCP sink connection when creating an application. The host and port are both represented by strings. This object is provided as an argument to to_sink.\n"},"book/python/debugging.html":{"url":"book/python/debugging.html","title":"Debugging","keywords":"","body":"Debugging Python Wallaroo Applications\nAs you're developing Python Wallaroo applications, there will come a time where you will need to do some debugging during your development process. Debugging can be as simple as inserting a print statement in your code (we even do it in our examples) or a bit more involved by using a debugger to get backtraces and such. In this section we'll cover how to debug using print, an interactive debugger, and a remote debugger. It will help if you've gone through the Python API Introduction, Setting Up Your Environment for Wallaroo, and Writing Your Own Wallaroo Python Application sections prior to continuing so you're aware of the components that make up a Python Wallaroo application and how they interact with each other.\nDebugging Using print and repr\nThe simplest way to do some debugging would be to include a print statement in your code to analyze data. You can see several examples of this in our reverse example where we have print statements in our Encoder, Decoder, and Reverse classes. Here's an example in our compute function in our Reverse class:\ndef compute(self, data):\n    print \"compute\", data\n    return data[::-1]\n\nIn this example, we'll be printing the incoming data before we reverse it.\nUsing print is a very useful way to get logged output that you can return to and analyze after your program has completed running. However, there are some downsides when using print to debug; you'll need to add a print statement everywhere you predict you might need it, you can't get a \"state of the world\" look at your application, etc.\nUsing print in Python is not without risks, however. If you try to print a unicode string and your locale isn't set to unicode, you may encounter an error like the following:\n>>> u = u'\\ua000abcd\\u07b4'\n>>> print u\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nUnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\ua000' in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)\n\nWith a streaming input application, you can't always be certain about the contents of the data you try to print. However, you can effectively avoid this sort of error by printing the byte representation of your data intead, using print repr(data). In that case, the same code that resulted in an error before will provide a useful printout of the contents of the data object:\n>>> u = u'\\ua000abcd\\u07b4'\n>>> print repr(u)\nu'\\ua000abcd\\u07b4'\n\nDebugging Using PDB\n If you need a more robust tool to do debugging, the Python standard library provides pdb. pdb is an interactive debugger which gives you the option to set breakpoints, inspect the stack frames, and other features expected from an interactive debugger. A quick example of using pdb in your application would be importing the pdb module and then calling its set_trace() function. The import pdb command goes in the module you pass to --application-module when running machida. Usage example:\nimport pdb\n# ...\ndef application_setup(arg):\n    pdb.set_trace()\n        # ...\n\nThe above will insert a breakpoint in the current stack frame and allow you to inspect the application_setup function. pdb comes with a nice set of features so if you're interested in using it go have a look at the official documentation.\nOther Debugging Options\nDebugging using print or pdb is great because they're available on all platforms. However, we realize you might have your own debugging process. We encourage you to use the tools that best fit your needs and we are available to help get you set up if needed.\n"},"book/go/intro.html":{"url":"book/go/intro.html","title":"Go API Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Go API Introduction\nThe Wallaroo Go API can be used to write Wallaroo applications using Go. \nIn order to write a Wallaroo application in Go, the developer creates a series of functions and types that provide methods expected by Wallaroo (see Wallaroo Go API Classes for more detail).

If you see that, you can be assured that we are now sending data into our example application.\nCheck Out Some Metrics\nFirst Look\nOnce the sender has successfully connected, if you visit the Metrics UI the landing page should show you that the \"Celsius to Fahrenheit\" application has successfully connected.\n\nIf your landing page resembles the one above, the \"Celsius to Fahrenheit\" application has successfully connected to the Metrics UI.\nNow, let's have a look at some metrics. By clicking on the \"Celsius to Fahrenheit\" link, you'll be taken to the \"Application Dashboard\" page. On this page you should see metric stats for the following:\n\na single pipeline: Celsius Conversion\na single worker: Initializer\nthree computations: Add32, Decode Time in TCP Source, Multiply by 1.8\n\n\nYou'll see the metric stats update as data continues to be processed in our application.\nYou can then click into one of the elements within a category, to get to a detailed metrics page for that element.

We will start with the stateless reverseapplication from the examples section, then move on to an application that maintains and modifies state.\nA Stateless Application - Reverse Words\nThe reverse application is going to receive text as its input, reverse it, and then send out the reversed text to its sink. In order to do this, our application needs to provide the following functions:\n\nInput decoding - how to translate the incoming bytestream into a Go string\nComputation - this is where the input string is going to get reversed\nOutput encoding - how to construct and format the bytestream that will be sent out by the sink\n\nComputation\nLet's start with the computation, because that's the purpose of the application:\ntype Reverse struct {}\n\nfunc (r *Reverse) Name() string {\n  return \"reverse\"\n}\n\nfunc (r *Reverse) Compute(data interface{}) interface{} {\n  input := *(data.(*string))\n\n  // string reversal taken from\n  // https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/oPuBaYJ17t4\n\n  n := 0\n  rune := make([]rune, len(input))\n  for _, r := range input {\n    rune[n] = r\n    n++\n  }\n  rune = rune[0:n]\n  // Reverse\n  for i := 0; i \nA Computation has no state, so it only needs to define its name, and how to convert input data into output data. In this case, string reversal is done using some code we got from the go-lang nuts forum.\nYou'll notice that the type of argument to Compute is interface {}. Your data types are opaque to Wallaroo and could be of any type. For this reason, you'll see interface {} used in a number of places in the Wallaroo Go API.\nSink Encoder\nNext, we are going to define how the output gets constructed for the sink. It is important to remember that when using a TCP sink, Wallaroo sends its output over the network, so data going through the sink needs to be of type []byte.\ntype Encoder struct {}\n\nfunc (e *Encoder) Encode(data interface {}) []byte {\n  msg := data.(string)\n  return []byte(msg + \"\\n\")\n\nSourceDecoder\nNow, we also need to decode the incoming bytes of the source.\ntype Decoder struct {}\n\nfunc (d *Decoder) HeaderLength() uint64 {\n  return 4\n}\n\nfunc (d *Decoder) PayloadLength(b []byte) uint64 {\n  return uint64(binary.BigEndian.Uint32(b[0:4]))\n}\n\nfunc (d* Decoder) Decode(b []byte) interface{} {\n  x := string(b[:])\n  return &x\n}\n\nThis one is different. When using a TCP source, Wallaroo handles streams of bytes, and in order to do that efficiently, it uses a method called message framing. This means that Wallaroo requires input data to follow a special structure, as well as for the application to provide the mechanism with which to decode this data.\nTo read more about this, please refer to the Creating A Decoder section.\nFor our application purposes, we will simply define the structure and how it is going to get parsed:\n\nInput messages have the following structure: A fixed length PAYLOAD_SIZE followed by PAYLOAD\nWallaroo requires three methods to parse this type of message:\nHeaderLength(), which returns the number of bytes used for the PAYLOAD_SIZE in the message. This value tells Wallaroo how many bytes to read from the stream as HEADER.\nPayloadLength([]byte), which reads PAYLOAD_SIZE bytestring of the size returned by HeaderLength() and computes the size of PAYLOAD. It then returns that size as an integer to Wallaroo, which will then read that many bytes from the stream.\nDecode([]byte), which receives the remainder of the message, MSG, and decodes it into a Go object.\n\n\n\nIn our case:\n\nPAYLOAD_SIZE is a big-endian unsigned 64-bit integer, so we return 4 from HeaderLength() and use uint64(binary.BigEndian.Uint32(b[0:4])) to read it as an integer.\nPAYLOAD is our text that we are going to reverse.\n\nApplication Setup\nSo now that we have input decoding, computation, and output decoding defined, how do we build it all into an application?\nFor this, two things are needed:\n\nAn entry point for Wallaroo to create the application. This is the function ApplicationSetup() that you need to define.\nThe actual topology ApplicationSetup() is going to return for Wallaroo to create the application.\n\nApplication Builder and Pipelines\nAn application is constructed of pipelines which, in turn, are constructed from a sequence of a source, one or more computations and state computations, and optionally a sink. Our reverse application only has one pipeline, so we only need to create one:\napplication := app.MakeApplication(\"Reverse Word\")\napplication.NewPipeline(\"Reverse\", app.MakeTCPSourceConfig(inHost, inPort, &Decoder{})).\n\nEach pipeline must have a source, and each source must have a decoder, so NewPipeline takes a name and a TCPSourceConfig instance as its arguments.\nNext, we add the computation step:\nTo(&ReverseBuilder{}).\n\nAnd finally, we add the sink, using a TCPSinkConfig:\nToSink(app.MakeTCPSinkConfig(outHost, outPort, &Encoder{}))\n\nThe ApplicationSetup Entry Point\nAfter Wallaroo starts, it will try to execute its ApplicationSetup() function. This function is where the application builder steps from above are going to run.\n//export ApplicationSetup\nfunc ApplicationSetup() *C.char {\n  fs := flag.NewFlagSet(\"wallaroo\", flag.ExitOnError)\n  inHostsPortsArg := fs.String(\"in\", \"\", \"input host:port list\")\n  outHostsPortsArg := fs.String(\"out\", \"\", \"output host:port list\")\n\n  fs.Parse(wa.Args[1:])\n\n  inHostsPorts := hostsPortsToList(*inHostsPortsArg)\n\n  inHost := inHostsPorts[0][0]\n  inPort := inHostsPorts[0][1]\n\n  outHostsPorts := hostsPortsToList(*outHostsPortsArg)\n  outHost := outHostsPorts[0][0]\n  outPort := outHostsPorts[0][1]\n\n  wa.Serialize = Serialize\n  wa.Deserialize = Deserialize\n\n  application := app.MakeApplication(\"Reverse Word\")\n  application.NewPipeline(\"Reverse\", app.MakeTCPSourceConfig(inHost, inPort, &Decoder{})).\n    To(&ReverseBuilder{}).\n    ToSink(app.MakeTCPSinkConfig(outHost, outPort, &Encoder{}))\n\n  return C.CString(application.ToJson())\n}\n\nConfiguration objects are used to pass information about sources and sinks to the application builder.\nRunning reverse\nThe complete example is available here.

If you haven't reviewed the simple stateless application example yet, you can find it here.\nA Stateful Application - Alphabet\nOur stateful application is going to be a vote counter, called Alphabet. It receives as its input a message containing an alphabet character and a number of votes, which it then increments in its internal state. After each update, it sends the new updated vote count of that character to its output.\nAs with the Reverse Word example, we will list the components required:\n\nInput decoding\nOutput encoding\nComputation for adding votes\nState objects\nState change management\nA list of keys that are valid for partitioning our state objects\nA partitioning function\n\nComputation\nThe computation here is fairly straightforward: given a data object and a state object, update the state with the new data, and return some data that tells Wallaroo what to do next.\ntype AddVotes struct {}\n\nfunc (av *AddVotes) Name() string {\n  return \"add votes\"\n}\n\nfunc (av *AddVotes) Compute(data interface{}, state interface{}) (interface{}, bool) {\n  lv := data.(*LetterAndVotes)\n  rvt := state.(*RunningVoteTotal)\n  rvt.Update(lv)\n  return rvt.GetVotes(), true\n}\n\nLet's dig into our return values\nreturn rvt.GetVotes(), true\n\nThe first element, rvt.GetVotes(), is a message that we will send on to our next step. In this case, we will be sending information about votes for this letter on to a sink. The second element, true, is to let Wallaroo know if we should store an update for our state. By returning true, we are instructing Wallaroo to save our updated state so that in the event of a crash, we can recover to this point. Being able to recover from a crash is a good thing, so why wouldn't we always return true? There are two answers:\n\nYour computation might not have updated the state, in which case saving its state for recovery is wasteful.\nYou might only want to save after some changes. Saving your state can be expensive for large objects. There's a tradeoff that can be made between performance and safety.\n\nState and StateBuilder\nWe are going to partition by letter. We'll have a separate state object for every letter.\ntype RunningVoteTotal struct {\n  Letter byte\n  Votes uint64\n}\n\nfunc (tv *RunningVoteTotal) Update(votes *LetterAndVotes) {\n  tv.Letter = votes.Letter\n  tv.Votes += votes.Votes\n}\n\nfunc (tv *RunningVoteTotal) GetVotes() *LetterAndVotes {\n  return &LetterAndVotes{tv.Letter, tv.Votes}\n}\n\nLastly, a stateful application's pipeline is going to need a StateBuilder, so let's create one:\ntype RunningVotesTotalBuilder struct {}\n\nfunc (rvtb *RunningVotesTotalBuilder) Name() string {\n  return \"running votes total builder\"\n}\n\nfunc (rvtb *RunningVotesTotalBuilder) Build() interface{} {\n  return &RunningVoteTotal{}\n}\n\nEncoder\nBy this point, we've almost made it to the end of the line. The only thing left is the sink and encoding. We don't do anything fancy with our encoding. We take the letter and its vote count, and format it into a single line of text that our receiver can record.\ntype Encoder struct {}\n\nfunc (encoder *Encoder) Encode(data interface{}) []byte {\n  lav := data.(*LetterAndVotes)\n  output := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s => %d\\n\", string(lav.Letter), lav.Votes)\n\n  return []byte(output)\n}\n\nDecoder\nThe decoder, like the one in Reverse Word, is going to use a HeaderLength() of 4 bytes to denote a big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer. Then, for the data, it is expecting a single character followed by a big-endian 32-bit unsigned integer.\ntype Decoder struct {}\n\nfunc (d *Decoder) HeaderLength() uint64 {\n  return 4\n}\n\nfunc (d *Decoder) PayloadLength(b []byte) uint64 {\n  return uint64(binary.BigEndian.Uint32(b[0:4]))\n}\n\nfunc (d *Decoder) Decode(b []byte) interface{} {\n  letter := b[0]\n  vote_count := binary.BigEndian.Uint32(b[1:])\n\n  lav := LetterAndVotes{letter, uint64(vote_count)}\n  return &lav\n}\n\nApplication Setup\nFinally, let's set up our application topology:\n//export ApplicationSetup\nfunc ApplicationSetup() *C.char {\n  fs := flag.NewFlagSet(\"wallaroo\", flag.ExitOnError)\n  inHostsPortsArg := fs.String(\"in\", \"\", \"input host:port list\")\n  outHostsPortsArg := fs.String(\"out\", \"\", \"output host:port list\")\n\n  fs.Parse(wa.Args[1:])\n\n  inHostsPorts := hostsPortsToList(*inHostsPortsArg)\n\n  inHost := inHostsPorts[0][0]\n  inPort := inHostsPorts[0][1]\n\n  outHostsPorts := hostsPortsToList(*outHostsPortsArg)\n  outHost := outHostsPorts[0][0]\n  outPort := outHostsPorts[0][1]\n\n  wa.Serialize = Serialize\n  wa.Deserialize = Deserialize\n\n  application := app.MakeApplication(\"Alphabet\")\n  application.NewPipeline(\"Alphabet\", app.MakeTCPSourceConfig(inHost, inPort, &Decoder{})).\n    ToStatePartition(&AddVotes{}, &RunningVotesTotalBuilder{}, \"running vote totals\", &LetterPartitionFunction{}, MakeLetterPartitions()).\n    ToSink(app.MakeTCPSinkConfig(outHost, outPort, &Encoder{}))\n\n  return C.CString(application.ToJson())\n}\n\nThe only difference between this setup and the stateless Reverse Word's one is that while in Reverse Word we used:\nTo(&ReverseBuilder{}).\n\nhere we use:\nToStatePartition(&AddVotes{}, &RunningVotesTotalBuilder{}, \"running vote totals\", &LetterPartitionFunction{}, MakeLetterPartitions()).\n\nThat is, while the stateless computation constructor To took only a computation class as its argument, the stateful computation constructor ToStatePartition takes a computation instance, as well as a state-builder instance, along with the name of that state. Additionally, it takes two arguments needed for partitioning our state.\nPartitioning\nPartitioning is a key aspect of how work is distributed in Wallaroo. From the application's point of view, what is required is:\n\na list of partition keys\na partitioning function\npartition-compatible states - the state should be defined in such a way that each partition can have its own distinct state instance\n\nPartition\nIf we were to use partitioning in the alphabet application from the previous section and we wanted to partition by key, then one way we could go about it is to create a partition key list.\nTo create a partition key list, we use the MakeLetterPartitions() function:\nfunc MakeLetterPartitions() []uint64 {\n  letterPartition := make([]uint64, 26)\n\n  for i := 0; i \nAnd then we define a partitioning function which returns a key from the above list for input data:\ntype LetterPartitionFunction struct {}\n\nfunc (lpf *LetterPartitionFunction) Partition(data interface{}) uint64 {\n  lav := data.(*LetterAndVotes)\n  return uint64(lav.Letter)\n}\n\nWhen we set up our state partition, we pass both functions above as arguments to ToStatePartition as we saw earlier:\nToStatePartition(&AddVotes{}, &RunningVotesTotalBuilder{}, \"running vote totals\", &LetterPartitionFunction{}, MakeLetterPartitions()).\n\nNext Steps\nThe complete alphabet example is available here. To run it, follow the Alphabet application instructions\nTo see how everything we've learned so far comes together, check out our Word Count walkthrough\nOur Alphabet application contains serialization and deserialization code that we didn't cover; to learn more, skip ahead to Interworker Serialization and Resilience.\n"},"book/go/api/word-count.html":{"url":"book/go/api/word-count.html","title":"Word Count","keywords":"","body":"Bringing it all together with word count\nWord count is the canonical streaming data application. It's canonical not because everyone needs to count words but because it's a good platform for demonstrating how to do many of the everyday tasks in a streaming application.\nThis section will take you through our Wallaroo word count example. Along the way, we will introduce you to a couple of new concepts: parallelizing stateless computations, and splitting one incoming message into several outgoing ones.\nWord count\nOur word counting application receives text input in the form of chunks of text. It then splits those chunks into lines and from there into individual words. We then send those words to a stateful partition where we increment the running count and finally, after updating, send as output the word and its current count.\nApplication Setup\nLet's dive in and take a look at our application setup:\n//export ApplicationSetup\nfunc ApplicationSetup() *C.char {\n    fs := flag.NewFlagSet(\"wallaroo\", flag.ExitOnError)\n    inHostsPortsArg := fs.String(\"in\", \"\", \"input host:port list\")\n    outHostsPortsArg := fs.String(\"out\", \"\", \"output host:port list\")\n\n    fs.Parse(wa.Args[1:])\n\n    inHostsPorts := hostsPortsToList(*inHostsPortsArg)\n\n    inHost := inHostsPorts[0][0]\n    inPort := inHostsPorts[0][1]\n\n    outHostsPorts := hostsPortsToList(*outHostsPortsArg)\n    outHost := outHostsPorts[0][0]\n    outPort := outHostsPorts[0][1]\n\n    wa.Serialize = Serialize\n    wa.Deserialize = Deserialize\n\n    application := app.MakeApplication(\"Word Count Application\")\n    application.NewPipeline(\"Split and Count\", app.MakeTCPSourceConfig(inHost, inPort, &Decoder{})).\n        ToMulti(&SplitBuilder{}).\n        ToStatePartition(&CountWord{}, &WordTotalsBuilder{}, \"word totals\", &WordPartitionFunction{}, LetterPartition()).\n        ToSink(app.MakeTCPSinkConfig(outHost, outPort, &Encoder{}))\n\n    json := application.ToJson()\n\n    return C.CString(json)\n}\n\nBy now, hopefully, most of this looks somewhat familiar. We're building on concepts we've seen in our previous example applications. We get the input and output information from the command line:\n    fs := flag.NewFlagSet(\"wallaroo\", flag.ExitOnError)\n    inHostsPortsArg := fs.String(\"in\", \"\", \"input host:port list\")\n    outHostsPortsArg := fs.String(\"out\", \"\", \"output host:port list\")\n\n    fs.Parse(wa.Args[1:])\n\n    inHostsPorts := hostsPortsToList(*inHostsPortsArg)\n\n    inHost := inHostsPorts[0][0]\n    inPort := inHostsPorts[0][1]\n\nWe point the Wallaroo serialization and deserialization functions to our serializer and deserializer:\n    wa.Serialize = Serialize\n    wa.Deserialize = Deserialize\n\nWe set up a new application with a single pipeline:\n    application := app.MakeApplication(\"Word Count Application\")\n    application.NewPipeline(\"Split and Count\", app.MakeTCPSourceConfig(inHost, inPort, &Decoder{})).\n        ToMulti(&SplitBuilder{}).\n        ToStatePartition(&CountWord{}, &WordTotalsBuilder{}, \"word totals\", &WordPartitionFunction{}, LetterPartition()).\n        ToSink(app.MakeTCPSinkConfig(outHost, outPort, &Encoder{}))\n\nUpon receiving some textual input, our word count application will route it to a stateless computation called Split. Split is responsible for breaking the text down into individual words:\n        ToMulti(&SplitBuilder{}).\n\nAfter we split our text chunks into words, they get routed to a state partition where they are counted:\n        ToStatePartition(&CountWord{}, &WordTotalsBuilder{}, \"word totals\", &WordPartitionFunction{}, LetterPartition()).\n\nNote we set up 27 partitions to count our words, one for each letter plus one called \"!\" which will handle any \"word\" that doesn't start with a letter:\nfunc LetterPartition() []uint64 {\n    letterPartition := make([]uint64, 27)\n\n    for i := 0; i \nSplitting Words\nOur word splitting is mostly uninteresting, except for one huge difference: our previous examples had one output for each input. When splitting text into words, we take one input and produce multiple outputs. Let's see how that is done.\ntype Split struct {}\n\nfunc (s *Split) Name() string {\n    return \"split\"\n}\n\nfunc (s *Split) Compute(data interface{}) []interface{} {\n    punctuation := \" !\\\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;?@[\\\\]^_`{|}~\"\n    lines := data.(*string)\n\n    words := make([]interface{}, 0)\n\n    for _, line := range strings.Split(*lines, \"\\n\") {\n        clean_line := strings.Trim(strings.ToLower(line), punctuation)\n        for _, word := range strings.Split(clean_line, \" \") {\n            clean_word := strings.Trim(word, punctuation)\n            words = append(words, &clean_word)\n        }\n    }\n\n    return words\n}\n\nDid you catch what is going on? Previously, we've seen our stateless computations have a Compute method that returns an interface{}. Split returns a []interface{}. Each item in the slice is a new message that is sent individually to the next step in the pipeline. This allows us to then route each message based on its first letter for counting. If you look below, you can see that our word partitioning function is expecting words, not a list, which makes sense:\ntype WordPartitionFunction struct {}\n\nfunc (wpf *WordPartitionFunction) Partition (data interface{}) uint64 {\n    word := data.(*string)\n    firstLetter := (*word)[0]\n    if (firstLetter >= 'a') && (firstLetter \nOur Counting Guts\nThe next three classes are the core of our word counting application. By this point, our messages have been split into individual words and run through our WordPartitionFunction and will arrive at a state computation based on the first letter of the word.\nLet's take a look at what we have. CountWord is a StateComputation. When it's run, we update our state to reflect the new incoming word. Then, it returns the return value from wordTotals.GetCount and true. The return value of GetCount is an instance of the WordCount class containing the word and its current count.\ntype CountWord struct {}\n\nfunc (cw *CountWord) Name() string {\n    return \"count word\"\n}\n\nfunc (cw *CountWord) Compute(data interface{}, state interface{}) (interface{}, bool) {\n    word := data.(*string)\n    wordTotals := state.(*WordTotals)\n    wordTotals.Update(*word)\n    return wordTotals.GetCount(*word), true\n}\n\nWordTotals isn't all that interesting. When we Update, we check to see if we have seen the word before and if not, add it to our map of words and set the count to one. If we have seen the word before, we increment its count. GetCount looks up a word and returns a WordCount for it.\nfunc MakeWordTotals() *WordTotals {\n    return &WordTotals{ make(map[string]uint64) }\n}\n\ntype WordTotals struct {\n    WordTotals map[string]uint64\n}\n\nfunc (wordTotals *WordTotals) Update(word string) {\n    total, found := wordTotals.WordTotals[word]\n    if !found {\n        total = 0\n    }\n    wordTotals.WordTotals[word] = total + 1\n}\n\nfunc (wordTotals *WordTotals) GetCount(word string) *WordCount {\n    return &WordCount{word, wordTotals.WordTotals[word]}\n}\n\nHello World! I'm a WordCount.\nBy this point, our word has almost made it to the end of the pipeline. The only thing left is the sink and encoding. We don't do anything fancy with our encoding. We take the word and its count, and we format it into a single line of text that our receiver can record.\ntype Encoder struct {}\n\nfunc (encoder *Encoder) Encode(data interface{}) []byte {\n    word_count := data.(*WordCount)\n    msg := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s => %d\\n\", word_count.Word, word_count.Count)\n    fmt.Println(msg)\n    return []byte(msg)\n}\n\nRunning word_count\nThe complete example is available here.

Worker processes send each other encoded objects, some of which may contain Go objects. In order to make this work, the application developer must provide serialization and deserialization functions that convert between objects and byte slices that represent those objects. The user then sets the wallarooapi.Serialization and wallarooapi.Deserialization variables to point to the user-defined serialization and deserialization function respectively.\nWallaroo applications can be made resilient by persisting their state to disk so that if they crash they can recover their state. The resilience system uses the same mechanism that is used for interworker serialization.\nSerialization\nSerialization is the process of creating a string of bytes that represents an object that will be sent to another worker. The application developer must provide a function with the signature func (interface{}) []byte that takes the object to be serialized as its argument and returns a byte slice that represents that object.\nDeserialization\nDeserialization is the other side of serialization, taking a string of bytes that represents an object and returning the object. The application developer must provide a function with the signature func ([]byte) interface{} that takes the byte slice representation of the object and returns the object.\nWhat Needs to Be Serialized and Deserialized\nYour application must handle all of these type of objects in its serialization and deserialization functions:\n\npartition functions\ndecoders\nencoders\ncomputations\ncomputation builders\nstate computations\nstate objects\nmessages that pass between steps in a topology\n\nAn Example Serializing Function\nAs an example of serialization, let's look at the Reverse\napplication. It converts a byte slice into a string, reverses\nthat string, and sends the reversed string to the encoder, which turns\nit into a byte slice. The serialization function looks like this:\nfunc Serialize(c interface{}) []byte {\n  switch t := c.(type) {\n  case *string:\n    buff := make([]byte, 4)\n    binary.BigEndian.PutUint32(buff, stringType)\n    var b bytes.Buffer\n    enc := gob.NewEncoder(&b)\n    enc.Encode(c)\n    return append(buff, b.Bytes()...)\n  case *Reverse:\n     buff := make([]byte, 4)\n    binary.BigEndian.PutUint32(buff, reverseType)\n    return buff\n  case *ReverseBuilder:\n    buff := make([]byte, 4)\n    binary.BigEndian.PutUint32(buff, reverseBuilderType)\n    return buff\n  case *Decoder:\n    buff := make([]byte, 4)\n    binary.BigEndian.PutUint32(buff, decoderType)\n    return buff\n  case *Encoder:\n    buff := make([]byte, 4)\n    binary.BigEndian.PutUint32(buff, encoderType)\n    return buff\n  default:\n    fmt.Println(\"SERIALIZE MISSED A CASE\")\n    fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(t))\n  }\n\n  return nil\n}\n\nThe switch statement handles all of the types that need to be serialized.  (Remember, the Reverse application does not use stateful computations.  Cases for partition functions, state computations, and state objects do not appear in this example).\n\ndecoders -- the Decoder class\nencoders -- the Encoder class\ncomputations -- the Reverse class\ncomputation builders -- the ReverseBuilder class\nmessages that pass between steps in a topology -- the string class\n\nYou are free to select any encoding mechanism that you would like. In\nthis example we have used a 32-bit integer to represent the type of\nthe encoded class. If the class has any data associated with it, like\nthe string class, you will need to encode that data as well. Go\nprovides the gob module which can encode and decode objects for you;\nwe recommend you use this unless you have a specific need that it does\nnot satisfy.\nAn Example Deserializing Function\nThe decoder function performs the opposite operation, taking an\nserialized representation and converting it into the object that is\nrepresented. The Reverse application's deserialization function looks\nlike this:\nfunc Deserialize(buff []byte) interface{} {\n  componentType := binary.BigEndian.Uint32(buff[:4])\n  payload := buff[4:]\n\n  switch componentType {\n  case stringType:\n    b := bytes.NewBuffer(payload)\n    dec := gob.NewDecoder(b)\n    var s string\n    dec.Decode(&s)\n    return &s\n  case reverseType:\n    return &Reverse{}\n  case reverseBuilderType:\n    return &ReverseBuilder{}\n  case decoderType:\n    return &Decoder{}\n  case encoderType:\n    return &Encoder{}\n  default:\n    fmt.Println(\"DESERIALIZE MISSED A CASE\")\n  }\n\n  return nil\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n}\n\nThe deserialization function in this example gets the first four bytes\nand uses that to determine the type of the object. It then creates the\nthe appropriate object and fills it with any data that it needs.\n"},"book/go/api/start-a-project.html":{"url":"book/go/api/start-a-project.html","title":"Start A Go Project","keywords":"","body":"Starting a Wallaroo Go Project\nThere are a few things that need to be done in order to start a Wallaroo Go project.\nCreate an Application Directory\nThe application should live in its own directory.

You should run these commands in the project directory so that the bundle.json file will be created there.\nThe easiest thing to do would be to create a shell variable that contains the path to where you have cloned the Wallaroo repo. For example, if it is your home directory then your shell variable would be set with:\nWALLAROO_HOME=$HOME/wallaroo\n\nOnce you've done that, you can run the following commands to create the bundle.json file:\nstable add local $WALLAROO_HOME/lib\nstable add local $WALLAROO_HOME/go_api/pony\nstable add github WallarooLabs/pony-kafka --tag=0.3.0\nstable add local lib\n\nThe contents of the bundle.json file will look something like this:\n{\n    \"deps\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"local\",\n            \"local-path\": \"/Users/aturley/wallaroo/lib\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"local\",\n            \"local-path\": \"/Users/aturley/wallaroo/go_api/pony\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"github\",\n            \"repo\": \"WallarooLabs/pony-kafka\",\n            \"tag\": \"0.3.0\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"local\",\n            \"local-path\": \"lib\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nAfter you've created the bundle.json file, you should fetch the dependencies:\nstable fetch\n\nCreate a go Workspace\nWithin your project directory you should create a directory hierarchy that looks like this:\ngo\n+--src\n   +--PROJECT_NAME\nPROJECT_NAME should be the name of your project. You can do this with a command like:\nmkdir -p go/src/PROJECT_NAME\n\nCreate a Wallaroo Go Application\nThe code for your application should be under the go/src/PROJECT_NAME directory that you created. There must be a main package with an empty main() function, and your program must export a C function called ApplicationSetup. You must also set the wallarooapi.Serialize and wallarooapi.Deserialize variables. Here's an outline of what the application file might look like:\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"C\"\n    wa \"wallarooapi\"\n    // other imports\n    // ...\n)\n\n//export ApplicationSetup\nfunc ApplicationSetup() *C.char {\n    wa.Serialize = Serialize\n    wa.Deserialize = Deserialize\n    // create the application pipelines\n    // ...\n    json := application.ToJson()\n    return C.CString(json)\n}\n\n// define the application classes\n// ..\n\nfunc Serialize(c interface{}) []byte {\n    // define your serialization strategy\n    // ...\n}\n\nfunc Deserialize(buff []byte) interface{} {\n    // define your deserialization strategy\n    // ..\n}\n\nfunc main() {}\n\nBuild Your Application\nSet Up GOPATH\nThe GOPATH must refer to the workspaces that contain both your application code and the Go API code. If you created a WALLAROO_HOME variable earlier, you can use it to set your GOPATH by running this command in your project directory:\nexport GOPATH=${WALLAROO_HOME}/go_api/go:$(pwd)/go\n\nThe first part of the GOPATH points to the Wallaroo Go API workspace, and the second part points to your project's workspace.\nBuild the Go Application as a Library\nUse the Go compiler to build the Go code as a library archive:\ngo build -buildmode=c-archive -o lib/libwallaroo.a PROJECT_NAME\n\nThis will place the library in a directory called lib.\nBuild the Wallaroo Application\nUse stable to invoke the Pony compiler so that it uses the imported libraries:\nstable env ponyc\n\nOnce you've done this, you will have an executable with the same name as the project directory.

It is a plain Go object and can be as simple or as complex as you would like it to be.\nA common issue that arises with asynchronous execution is that when references to mutable objects are passed to the next step, if another update to the state precedes the execution of the next step, it will then execute with the latest state (that is, it will execute with the \"wrong\" state). Therefore, anything returned by a StateComputation that is based on data from the state object should use a copy of that data rather than a reference to something in the state object itself.\nIt is up to the developer to provide a side-effect safe value for the StateComputation to return!\nExample State\nThe RunningVoteTotal keeps a count of how many times each letter in the alphabet has been seen:\ntype RunningVoteTotal struct {\n  Letter byte\n  Votes uint64\n}\n\nfunc (tv *RunningVoteTotal) Update(votes *LetterAndVotes) {\n  tv.Letter = votes.Letter\n  tv.Votes += votes.Votes\n}\n\nfunc (tv *RunningVoteTotal) GetVotes() *LetterAndVotes {\n  return &LetterAndVotes{tv.Letter, tv.Votes}\n}\n\nwallarooapi.StateBuilder\nA StateBuilder is used by Wallaroo to create an initial state object for a StateComputation or StateComputationMulti.\nwallarooapi.StateBuilder Methods\nName() string\nReturn a string representing the name of the state.\nBuild() interface{}\nReturn a new state instance.\nExample StateBuilder\nReturn a RunningVoteTotal object with the values initialized to defaults.\ntype RunningVotesTotalBuilder struct {}\n\nfunc (rvtb *RunningVotesTotalBuilder) Name() string {\n    return \"running votes total builder\"\n}\n\nfunc (rvtb *RunningVotesTotalBuilder) Build() interface{} {\n    return &RunningVoteTotal{}\n}\n\nwallarooapi.StateComputation\nA StateComputation is similar to a Computation, except that its Compute method takes an additional argument: state.\nIn order to provide resilience, Wallaroo needs to keep track of state changes, or side effects, and it does so by making state an explicit object that is given as input to any StateComputation step.\nLike Computation, a StateComputation class must provide the Name and Compute methods.\nwallarooapi.StateComputation Methods\nName() string\nReturn the name of the computation as a string.\nCompute(data interface{}, state interface{}) (interface {}, bool)\ndata is anything that was returned by the previous step in the pipeline, and state is provided by the StateBuilder that was defined for this step in the pipeline definition.\nThe first return value is a message that we will send on to our next step. It should be a new object. Returning nil will stop processing that message and no messages will be sent to the next step. The second return value instructs Wallaroo to save our updated state so that in the event of a crash, we can recover to this point. Return true if you wish to save the state, otherwise return false.\nWhy wouldn't we always return true? There are two answers:\n\nYour computation might not have updated the state, in which case saving its state for recovery is wasteful.\nYou might only want to save after some changes. Saving your state can be expensive for large objects. There's a tradeoff that can be made between performance and safety.\n\nExample StateComputation\nAn example StateComputation that keeps track of the number of votes that have been seen:\ntype AddVotes struct {}\n\nfunc (av *AddVotes) Name() string {\n  return \"add votes\"\n}\n\nfunc (av *AddVotes) Compute(data interface{}, state interface{}) (interface{}, bool) {\n  lv := data.(*LetterAndVotes)\n  rvt := state.(*RunningVoteTotal)\n  rvt.Update(lv)\n  return rvt.GetVotes(), true\n}\n\nwallarooapi.StateComputationMulti\nA StateComputationMulti is similar to a StateComputation, except that its Compute method returns a []interface{}, where each object in the slice is sent out as a different message to the next step in the pipeline.\nwallarooapi.StateComputationMulti Methods\nName() string\nReturn the name of the computation as a string.\nCompute(data interface{}, state interface{}) ([]interface {}, bool)\ndata is anything that was returned by the previous step in the pipeline, and state is provided by the StateBuilder that was defined for this step in the pipeline definition.\nThe first return value is a slice of object that we will send on to our next step, where each object is a different message. Returning nil will stop processing that message and no messages will be sent to the next step. The second return value instructs Wallaroo to save our updated state so that in the event of a crash, we can recover to this point. Return true if you wish to save the state, otherwise return false.\nwallaroo.application.TCPSourceConfig\nA TCPSourceConfig object specifies the host, port, and encoder to use for a TCP source connection when creating an application.

Any Wallaroo cluster will have one worker designated as the \"cluster initializer\", a temporary role played during cluster initialization. \nWorkers communicate with each other over two channels: a control channel and a data channel. They send metrics data over TCP to an external metrics address. And they optionally listen for messages from external systems over an external channel.  \nDepending on the type of sources and sinks used in your application, you might need to provide more configuration information.  For example, a TCP source requires a network address so that it can listen for incoming data.  And a TCP sink requires a target address where it can send output data.\nIn this document, we'll discuss most of the command line arguments that can be passed to a Wallaroo binary.  For a complete list, see Wallaroo Command Line Options.\nSingle Worker Setup\nIf you are starting up a Wallaroo cluster with only one worker, then that worker must be configured as the \"cluster initializer\" by passing the --cluster-initializer flag. You must also specify a target address for metrics data using the --metrics parameter. And you must specify its control and data addresses via the --control and --data command line parameters (these will be used if more workers are added to the cluster later). \nIf your application uses a TCP source, then you must specify a TCP input address via --in. Likewise, if your application uses a TCP sink, then you must specify a TCP output address via --out. In what follows, we'll be using the Celsius Converter example app which uses a TCP source and sink (there are versions of this app written in Go and Python).\nIf you are using the Go or Pony APIs, then you will run a binary called celsius in order to run the Celsius Converter app. If you are using the Python API, then you will run Machida, passing in the application name via --application-module. And since Machida is single-threaded, you must pass in --ponythreads 1 (otherwise the cluster will crash).\nPutting this all together, to run the Celsius Converter app, you would run the following command:\nPythonGo```\nmachida --application-module celsius --in 127.0.0.1:7010 --out 127.0.0.1:7002 \\\n  --metrics 127.0.0.1:5001 --control 127.0.0.1:6000 --data 127.0.0.1:6001 \\\n  --cluster-initializer --ponythreads 1\n```\n```\ncelsius --in 127.0.0.1:7010 --out 127.0.0.1:7002 \\\n  --metrics 127.0.0.1:5001 --control 127.0.0.1:6000 --data 127.0.0.1:6001 \\\n  --cluster-initializer\n```\n\nIf you want to be able to send messages to your worker from external systems (for example, to trigger a cluster shutdown using the Cluster Shutdown tool), then you need to have the worker listen on an \"external channel\". This is accomplished by providing an address via the --external argument.\nMulti-Worker Setup\nA Wallaroo application can alo be distributed over multiple Wallaroo workers. This requires that the clustering feature flag has been set during build (it is set by default when building via provided Makefiles in the Wallaroo repo). From among our multiple workers, we will have one play the role of initializer via the --cluster-initializer flag. We specify the total number of workers at startup (including the initializer) via the --worker-count parameter, which we pass to whichever worker we have chosen to be the initializer. We do not pass the worker count to any other workers at startup. As with the single worker case, we also pass the initializer its control and data channel addresses via --control and --data.\nYou must provide a name for any worker that's not the initializer via the --name argument. Currently, the initializer's name will always be set to \"initializer\", even if you provide it with a different name. We plan to change this in the future so that you can name the initializer as well.\nYou need to tell every non-initializer worker which addresses the initializer is listening on for its control channel. This is done via the --control argument. We must also specify the metrics target via --metrics, just as we did in the single worker case above. And if we are using a TCP source and sink (as in the Celsius Converter app we're using as an example), then we must also pass every worker an --in and --out argument to specify the source and sink addresses.\nYou can optionally set the control and data addresses that a non-initializer will listen on by using the --my-control and --my-data arguments, respectively.\nAssuming we are running a two worker cluster on a single machine, we would run the following commands:\nPythonGo*Worker 1*\n\n```bash\nmachida --application-module celsius --in 127.0.0.1:6000 \\\n  --out 127.0.0.1:5555 --metrics 127.0.0.1:5001 \\\n  --control 127.0.0.1:6500 --data 127.0.0.1:6501 --worker-count 2 \\\n  --clutser-initializer --ponythreads 1\n```\n\n*Worker 2*\n\n```bash\nmachida --application-module celsius --in 127.0.0.1:6000 \\\n  --out 127.0.0.1:5555 --metrics 127.0.0.1:5001 \\\n  --control 127.0.0.1:6500 --name Worker2 --ponythreads 1\n```\n*Worker 1*\n\n```bash\ncelsius --in 127.0.0.1:6000 --out 127.0.0.1:5555 --metrics 127.0.0.1:5001 \\\n  --control 127.0.0.1:6500 --data 127.0.0.1:6501 --worker-count 2 \\\n  --clutser-initializer\n```\n\n*Worker 2*\n\n```bash\ncelsius --in 127.0.0.1:6000 --out 127.0.0.1:5555 --metrics 127.0.0.1:5001 \\\n  --control 127.0.0.1:6500 --name Worker2\n```\n\nRemember that multi-worker runs require that you distribute the same binary to all machines that are involved. Attempting to connect different binaries into a multi-worker cluster will fail.\nRestarting workers\nWhen a cluster is starting up, all members will save information about the cluster to local disk. If a member exits and is restarted, it uses the saved information to reconnect to the running cluster. By default, cluster information is stored in /tmp. You can change the directory using the --resilience-dir parameter.\nResilience files are based on the name you supply the worker so starting different applications or clusters and reusing names can lead to odd results if you have leftover files in your resilience directory. To avoid any weirdness, you should use our clean shutdown tool or make sure to \"manually\" clean your resilience directory. For example, if you were using /tmp/wallaroo as a resilience directory, you can manually clean it by running rm -rf /tmp/wallaroo/ to remove all cluster information files.\nShutting Down a Cluster\nWallaroo comes with a cluster shutdown tool that can be used to shut down a running cluster.\n"},"book/running-wallaroo/autoscale.html":{"url":"book/running-wallaroo/autoscale.html","title":"Autoscale","keywords":"","body":"Autoscale\nWallaroo is designed to support scale-independent development. It can adapt to changing demands by growing or shrinking to fit the available resources. You don’t have to update any code or bother with stopping your cluster and redeploying. This set of features is called “autoscale”.\nWith autoscale enabled, you can add or remove workers from a running cluster. We call these “grow to fit” and “shrink to fit”, respectively (referring to the fact that the cluster grows or shrinks to fit your current resource requirements). To enable autoscale, you must build a Wallaroo binary using the -D autoscale command line argument. Autoscale is set by default when running make for building Machida or the example Wallaroo applications.\nGrow to Fit\nWhile a Wallaroo cluster is running, new workers can join the cluster.  To add workers to a running cluster, you must know the control channel address of one of the workers in the running cluster.  Let’s assume it’s 127.0.0.1:12500.  The following command would allow us to add one worker to a running cluster for the alphabet example app:\nPythonGo```\nmachida --application-module alphabet --in 127.0.0.1:7010 \\\n  --out 127.0.0.1:7002 --join 127.0.0.1:12500 --name w3 \\\n  --ponythreads 1\n```\n```\nalphabet --in 127.0.0.1:7010 --out 127.0.0.1:7002 \\\n  --join 127.0.0.1:12500 --name w3\n```\n\nThe --in argument specifies the port that the TCP source will listen on, and the --out argument specifies the target address for data output over TCP. --join is used to specify the control channel address of the running worker we are contacting in order to join.  --name is used to specify the name of the joining worker.\nIf you want to add more than 1 worker at a time, you must have all workers contact the same running worker and all must specify the same joining worker total as the worker_count command line argument.  For example, if 3 workers are joining, then in our case, they could all use --join 127.0.0.1:12500 and --worker_count 3.  Their command lines might be as follows:\nPythonGo```\nmachida --application-module alphabet --in 127.0.0.1:7010 \\\n  --out 127.0.0.1:7002 --join 127.0.0.1:12500 --name w3 --worker_count 3 \\\n  --ponythreads 1\n\nmachida --application-module alphabet --in 127.0.0.1:7010 \\\n  --out 127.0.0.1:7002 --join 127.0.0.1:12500 --name w4 --worker_count 3 \\\n  --ponythreads 1\n\nmachida --application-module alphabet --in 127.0.0.1:7010 \\\n  --out 127.0.0.1:7002 --join 127.0.0.1:12500 --name w5 --worker_count 3 \\\n  --ponythreads 1\n```\n```\nalphabet --in 127.0.0.1:7010 --out 127.0.0.1:7002 \\\n  --join 127.0.0.1:12500 --name w3 --worker_count 3\n\nalphabet --in 127.0.0.1:7010 --out 127.0.0.1:7002 \\\n  --join 127.0.0.1:12500 --name w4 --worker_count 3\n\nalphabet --in 127.0.0.1:7010 --out 127.0.0.1:7002 \\\n  --join 127.0.0.1:12500 --name w5 --worker_count 3\n```\n\nShrink to Fit\nIt is also possible to remove one or more workers from a running cluster. \nThere are two ways to specify that workers should be removed from the cluster.  You can either specify the worker names or the total count of workers to be removed.  You must know the external channel address of one worker in the running cluster.  You can use the external_sender tool to send a shrink message to this channel. For example, if the external address is 127.0.0.1:5050 and we want to remove 2 workers from the cluster, we can run the following:\nexternal_sender --type shrink --external 127.0.0.1:5050 --message 2\nThe --message argument is used either to pass in a count or to pass in a list of comma-separated worker names.  To request that workers w2 and w3 be removed, we can run:\nexternal_sender --type shrink --external 127.0.0.1:5050 --message w2,w3\nTo qualify for removal from the cluster, a worker must currently meet two criteria:\n\nIt must have no sources placed on it.\nIt must have no non-parallelized stateless computations placed on it.\n\nIf you send in a list of worker names that includes at least one invalid worker (either because the worker does not meet the 2 criteria or because it is an invalid name) then the shrink will not happen. If you send in a shrink count that’s higher than the number of workers meeting the 2 criteria, then Wallaroo will shrink by the maximum number of workers that do meet those criteria (which could be 0).\nThe leaving workers will migrate state to the remaining workers and then shut down. The remaining workers will then handle all work for the application.\nYou can query a running cluster to get a list of workers eligible for shutdown. In order to do this, pass \\? as the argument to --message as below:\nexternal_sender --type shrink --external 127.0.0.1:5050 --message \\? \\\n  --stay-alive\n"},"book/running-wallaroo/wallaroo-command-line-options.html":{"url":"book/running-wallaroo/wallaroo-command-line-options.html","title":"Command line options","keywords":"","body":"Wallaroo Command-Line Options\nEvery Wallaroo option exposes a set of command-line options that are used to configure it. This document gives an overview of each of those options.\nCommand-Line Parameters\nWhen running a Wallaroo application, we use some of the following command line parameters (a star indicates it is required, a plus that it is required for multi-worker runs):\n  --control/-c *[Sets address for initializer control channel; sets\n    control address to connect to for non-initializers]\n  --data/-d *[Sets address for initializer data channel]\n  --my-control [Optionally sets address for my data channel]\n  --my-data [Optionally sets address for my data channel]\n  --external/-e [Sets address for external message channel]\n  --worker-count/-w +[Sets cluster initializer\\'s total number of workers,\n    including cluster initializer itself]\n  --name/-n +[Sets name for this worker. Initializer will overwrite this \n    name with \"initializer\"]\n\n  --metrics/-m *[Sets address for external metrics (e.g. monitoring hub)]\n  --cluster-initializer/-t *[Sets this process as the cluster\n    initializing process (that status is meaningless after init is done)]\n  --resilience-dir/-r [Sets directory to write resilience files to,\n    e.g. -r /tmp/data (no trailing slash)]\n  --log-rotation [Enables log rotation. Default: off]\n  --event-log-file-size/-l [Optionally set a file size for triggering\n    event log file rotation. If no file size is set, log rotation is only\n    triggered by external control messages sent to the address used with\n    --external]\n\n  --join/j [When a new worker is joining a running cluster, pass the\n    control channel address of any worker as the value for this\n    parameter]\n  --stop-world/u [Sets pause before state migration after the stop the\n    world]\n\nWallaroo currently supports one source per pipeline, which is setup by the application code. Each pipeline may have at most one sink, which is also set up by the application code.\nIn order to monitor metrics, the target address for metrics data should be defined via the --metrics/-m parameter, using a host:port format (e.g. 127.0.0.1:5002).\nMachida specific parameters\nIn addition to the Wallaroo command line paramters, Machida, the python-wallaroo interface, takes the additional argument\n  --application-module *[Specify the Machida application module]\n\n--application-module specifies the name that machida will attempt to import as the Python Wallaroo application file. For example, if you write a Python Wallaroo application and save it as my_application.py, then you should provide that name to machida as --application-module my_application.\nResilience\nIf resilience is turned on, you can optionally specify the target directory for resilience files via the --resilience-dir/-r parameter (default is /tmp), and whether or not log should be rotated (--log-rotation, off by default). If log rotation is enabled, you may also set the file size on which to trigger log rotation (per worker, in bytes). If no file size is set, log rotation will only happen if it is requested via an external control channel message sent to the address specified in the cluster intializer worker's --external parameter. If a file size is set, log rotation may trigger if either the log file reaches the specified file size, or if a log rotation is requested for the worker via the external control channel.\nPerformance Flags\nYou can specify how many threads a Wallaroo process will use via the following\nargument:\n--ponythreads=4\n\nIf you do not specify the number of ponythreads, the process will try to use all available cores.\nSince Machida (used for the Python API) is single-threaded, you must run it with --ponythreads 1 or the cluster will crash.\nThere are additional performance flags--ponypinasio and --ponynoblock that can be used as part of a high-performance configuration.

In this section, we are going to dive more into how you work with sources and sinks. We'll be covering two key concepts: Decoders and Encoders. \nReviewing our terms\nSource\nInput point for data from external systems into an application.\nSink\nOutput point from an application to external systems.\nDecoder\nCode that transforms a stream of bytes from an external system\ninto a series of application input types.\nEncoder\nCode that transforms an application output type into bytes for\nsending to an external system.\nFramed Message Protocols\nA Wallaroo TCP Source accepts a stream of bytes from an external source and turns that stream of bytes into a stream of application specific messages. As an application programmer, you provide a Decoder to tell Wallaroo how to turn that stream of bytes into messages.\nAn incoming stream of bytes can represent many things: each byte could be an 8-bit unsigned integer, or every 4-byte block may be a 32-bit integer. Or the stream may be an ASCII sequence (each byte is a char), or a Unicode sequence (in which case characters aren't equally-wide!).\nDecoders are unique to the type of source. TCPSources use a framed message protocol. A framed message protocol boils down to:\n\nWe have a fixed size header that tells us how long a message is\nWe have a variable length message payload \n\nThe message payload is what our application cares about. The fixed length header allows us to easily get the size of our payload. With these two pieces of information, we can quickly chop up a stream of incoming bytes into a series of messages.\nThe size of the header is up to you the designer of the particular message type. You can make it 4 bytes, 8 bytes, 16, et cetera. The important part is that you need enough bytes to represent the length of your payload. For most data, a 4-byte header is plenty. In the abstract, this looks like\nPayloadSize [x bytes] : Payload [bytes specified in PayloadSize]\nSo if our header is 4 bytes long, an incoming message would look something like:\n\n\n\nheader\npayload\n\n\n\n\nxxxx\nsome data here\n\n\n\nLet's make that a bit more concrete. Let's say we are sending in two messages; each contains a string. The first has \"first\" as a payload and the second payload is \"not first\". Our stream of bytes would be:\n\n4-byte header whose value is 5\n5-byte payload containing the binary representation of the ASCII string \"first\"\n4-byte header whose value is 9\n9 byte payload containing the binary representation of the ASCII string \"not first\"\n\nCreating a Decoder\nWallaroo's TCPSource takes a decoder function that can process a framed message protocol. You'll need to implement three methods. Below is a decoder that we can use to process our stream of strings that we layed out in the previous section.\n@wallaroo.decoder(header_length=4, length_fmt=\">I\")\ndef decode(self, bs):\n    return bs.decode(\"utf-8\")\n\nheader_length is the fixed size of our payload field. \nlength_fmt is used internally to decode our message header to determine how long the payload is going to be. We rely on the Python struct package to decode the bytes. If you aren't familiar with struct, you can check out the documentation to learn more. Remember, when using struct, don't forget to import it!\ndecode takes a series of bytes that represent your payload and turns it into an application message. In this case, our application message is a string, so we take the incoming byte stream bs and convert it to UTF-8 Python string.\nHere's a slightly more complicated example taken from our Alphabet Popularity Contest example. \n@wallaroo.decoder(header_length=4, length_fmt=\">I\")\ndef decode(self, bs):\n    (letter, vote_count) = struct.unpack(\">sI\", bs)\n    return Votes(letter, vote_count)\n\nLike we did in our previous example, we're using a 4-byte integer payload length header:\n@wallaroo.decoder(header_length=4, length_fmt=\">I\")\n\nBut this time, we are doing something slightly more complicated in our payload. Our payload is two items, a string representing a letter and some votes for that letter. We'll unpack those using struct and create a domain specific object Votes to return.\ndef decode(self, bs):\n    (letter, vote_count) = struct.unpack(\">sI\", bs)\n    return Votes(letter, vote_count)\n\nCreating an Encoder\nWallaroo encoders do the opposite of decoders. A decoder takes a stream of bytes and turns in into messages for Wallaroo to process. An encoder receives a stream of messages and converts them into a stream of bytes for sending to another system.\nHere's a quick example encoder:\n@wallaroo.encoder\ndef encode(self, data):\n    # data is a string\n    return data + \"\\n\"\n\nThis is just about the simplest encoder you could have. It's from the Reverse Word example. It takes a string that we want to send to an external system as an input, adds a newline at the end and returns it for sending. \nHere's a more complicated example taken from our Alphabet Popularity Contest example:\nclass Votes(object):\n    def __init__(self, letter, votes):\n        self.letter = letter\n        self.votes = votes\n\n@wallaroo.encoder\ndef encode(self, data):\n    # data is a Votes\n    return struct.pack(\">IsQ\", 9, data.letter, data.votes)\n\nLet's take a look at what is happening here. First of all, we are once again using the Python struct package. In this case, though, we are creating our own packed binary message. It's a framed message with a 4-byte header for the payload length, plus the payload:\n| header | payload |\n| 9 | letter & votes |\nIf we were encoding the letter \"A\" and a vote value of \"1\" our payload would be 'A\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x01'. This along with our framing data can be sent along to another system that expects framed data.\n"},"book/wallaroo-tools/giles-sender.html":{"url":"book/wallaroo-tools/giles-sender.html","title":"Sending Data over TCP with Giles Sender","keywords":"","body":"Giles Sender\nOverview\nGiles components act as external testers for Wallaroo.

This option is useful when benchmarking application speed, where the sink could potentially be a bottleneck.\n\nBuilding giles/receiver\nIf you do not already have the wallaroo repo, create a local copy of the repo:\ngit clone https://github.com/WallarooLabs/wallaroo\n\nCompile the giles-receiver binary:\ncd wallaroo/giles/receiver\nmake\n\nCommand Line Arguments\ngiles/receiver takes several command line arguments, below are a list with accompanying notes:\n\n--listen/-l address to listen on for incoming data from Wallaroo.

The reason is two-fold:\n\nIf the giles sender and receiver are run on the same physical machine, then their monotonic unadjusted clock is synchronised, and therefore the timestamps from giles/sender and giles/receiver can be used to compute total latencies, assuming one can relate a message in giles/sender's sent.txt to a message in giles/receiver's received.txt.\nWhile doing performance tuning, we noticed that netcat sometimes struggles to handle heavy loads. This is understandable, as it was never designed with that purpose. giles/receiver, on the other hand, is specifically designed to not be bottoleneck when it is used in performance tuning a Wallaroo application.\n\nOutput File Format\nGiles Receiver saves incoming messages in a binary format of the following specification:\n\nMessage Length: A 32-bit (4-byte) unsigned integer specifying the length of the binary message.\nTimestamp: a 64-bit (8-byte) unsigned integer specificying the unadjusted monotonic time (in nanoseconds) at which the the message was received. This timestamp is specific to the machine that is performing this encoding and cannot be translated across machines.\nA binary blob length Message Length\n\nAn example for such an entry, with a binary message of 10 bytes and the timestamp 10 is\n'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\nabcdefghij'\nNote that you cannot trust newlines as separators in this encoding. As you can see in the encoded entry above, the character '\\n' appears  in both the message_length entry '\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n' and in the timestamp entry '\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n'.\nSo care must be taken when decoding giles-receiver output files to not assume that any character separator is safe for use. Instead, the recommended way to decode these files is to treat their contents as a bytestream, and decode them one message at at time in the following manner:\n\nRead the first 4 bytes and convert them from a big-endian 32-bit unsigned int to a number in your decoder.\nRead the next 8 bytes, and if you have a use for the monotonic unadjusted nanoseconds timestamp, convert it to a number from a big-endian 64-bit unsigned integer.\nRead message_length bytes and decode according to your application's SinkEncoder encoding scheme, if desired.\nSave or process the message\nGOTO 1\n\nFor decoding the output, please see Decoding Giles Receiver Output.\n"},"book/metrics/metrics-ui.html":{"url":"book/metrics/metrics-ui.html","title":"Monitoring Metrics with the Monitoring Hub","keywords":"","body":"Wallaroo Metrics UI\nIntroduction\nIn this section, we'll introduce you to the Wallaroo Metrics UI. The Metrics UI is a tool to allow you to get soft real-time metric updates for any connected Wallaroo applications. The Metrics UI will provide you with a general and detailed performance overview of each running application.\nMetrics are reported for 3 top level categories in a Wallaroo application: Pipelines, Workers, and Computations. Each top level category is an aggregation of elements in its own subcategory. The Metrics UI also provides metrics for each subcategory. All metrics are provided using a time window of the last 5 minutes of processing.\nAt this point we assume you've made your way through the Setting Up Your Environment for Wallaroo and Core Concepts sections of the documentation. If you haven't, please do so and return here once you have.\nGetting Started with the Metrics UI\nIn Docker\nYou should already have Docker installed if you have followed the Setup instructions in the Setting Up Your Environment for Wallaroo section of the documentation.\nRunning the Metrics UI\nNOTE: You might need to run with sudo depending on how you set up Docker.\nOnce you have Docker setup, you can grab the Metrics UI image by running:\ndocker pull wallaroo-labs-docker-wallaroolabs.bintray.io/release/metrics_ui:0.3.3\nTo start the Metrics UI you will run:\ndocker run -d --name mui -p 0.0.0.0:4000:4000 -p 0.0.0.0:5001:5001 \\\n  wallaroo-labs-docker-wallaroolabs.bintray.io/release/metrics_ui:0.3.3\n\nIf you are running locally, open http://localhost:4000\nin your browser to verify the Metrics UI is up and running.\nTo restart and stop the Metrics UI you can run the following:\ndocker restart mui\n\ndocker stop mui\n\nIf you'd like to start the Metrics UI back up after it has been stopped run:\ndocker start mui\n\nWhat are Wallaroo Metrics?\nTo establish performance criteria for Wallaroo applications, We decided to use two key metrics:\n\nLatency: the amount of time it takes to process an individual event, measured as the percentile of the latency for a sample of events.\nThroughput: a count of events (as defined by their category) processed per second.\n\nLatency Metrics\nLatency metrics are calculated using fixed bin histograms. Each bin represents the percentage of messages that fall within the time frame assigned to that bin. A bins time frame is defined as greater than the upper limit of the bin before it (or 0, if no bin precedes) and less than or equal to its own upper limit. (ex. Bin Range: 1ms \nWhy fixed bins? Fixed bin histograms allow for inexpensive processing on the Wallaroo side and give us the ability to answer questions such as:\nWhat percentage of events completed in less than x milliseconds?\nBy aggregating the data within these bins, we can provide users with the following stats: 50th Percentile Bin, 90th Percentile Bin, 95th Percentile Bin, 99th Percentile Bin, and 99.9th Percentile Bin. (x Percentile Bin representing the upper limit of the bin that x percent of calculated latencies fall within) We also provide a Percentage by Bin graph. This graph aggregates across a set of key bins in order to give a quick overview of performance in relation to bins that we find meaningful to the user.\nThroughput Metrics\nThroughput metric stats are calculated for our last 5 minutes time window and we provide the minimum, median, and maximum throughput observed. We also provide a Throughput per Second graph of the median for the last 5 minutes, which can be used to quickly see if there has been a spike in performance.\nMetric Categories\nPipeline Stats\nReported for every pipeline within an application. Calculated as the time a message was received in Wallaroo to its completion as defined by the pipeline.\nBecause a message can generate one or more outgoing messages, there are two throughputs recorded for a pipeline:\n1. Ingestion throughput, defined as how many messages entered a pipeline per second.\n2. Outbound throughput, defined as how many messages were processed by a pipeline per second.\nFor categories that display both ingestion throughput and outbount throughput, throughputs would be displayed preceding and following the -| symbol respectively.\nA pipelines total stats is an aggregation of each worker reporting stats for said pipeline.\nSubcategory: Pipeline by Worker Stats\nReported as the time of ingestion from the source to the time of completion for a message on a given worker for a pipeline. Includes network time if a message crosses boundaries between two workers.\nWorker Stats\nReported for every worker that is part of an application. Calculated as the time a message was received on a worker to its completion or hand off to another worker. Reported for every pipeline running on a worker. A workers total stats is an aggregation of each message passing through on this worker for a given pipeline.\nSubcategory: Worker by Pipeline Stats\nReported as the time of ingestion of a message on said worker to its completion or hand off to another worker for a given pipeline.\nComputation Stats\nReported for every computation run within an application. Calculated as the time it takes for said computation to complete for a given message. Reported by every worker running said computation. A computations total stats is an aggregation of each worker reporting for a given computation.\nSubcategory: Computation by Worker Stats\nReported as the time to complete said computation on a worker for a given message.\nNow that we have an understanding of what metrics we'll be showing you and the categories we're reporting metrics for, let's have a look at the Metrics UI.\nPage by Page Overview\nIn this section, we'll give a page by page overview of the information presented to you via the Wallaroo Metrics UI. This information is presented via static images and does not fully convey the experience of using the Metrics UI live with a running Wallaroo application. To follow along on your own, follow the instructions in the Run a Wallaroo Application section. Once you've completed the Check Out Some Metrics section of that page and have visited the URL for the Metrics UI, you'll be ready to follow along as we take a deep dive into the Metrics UI.\nLanding\nThe landing page for the Metrics UI shows us a list of connected applications. In this case, we'll see the Celsius Conversion App.\n\nWe can then click on a specific application's title, to take us to that application's dashboard. So if you click on Celsius Conversion App, we'll arrive at its application dashboard.\nApplication Dashboard\nThe application dashboard gives us a high-level overview of that application's performance. This page is broken into a section for our three main categories: Pipelines, Workers, and Computations. We'll see a stats line for each element within a section. A stats line is broken down into a section for latency and a section for throughput. For latencies, we'll see the upper limit of the bin that 50%, 95%, and 99% of our messages processed fall under. For throughput, we'll see the minimum, median, and maximum. All stats in a stats line are for the last 5 minutes of processing. You can then click into a stat line's name to arrive at our detailed metrics page.\n\nLet's look at the elements that make up our Celsius Conversion application. We have a general Stats Overview Section for each category.\nAs we can see in our Pipeline Stats section, we're running a single pipeline Celsius Conversion. In our Worker Stats section we only have a single worker named Initializer processing data for our application. In our Computation Stats section we have 3 computations running: Add 32, Decode Time in TCP Source, and Multiply By 1.8.\nLet's click into our Celsius Conversion pipeline under Pipeline Stats to visit its Detailed Metrics page.\nDetailed Metrics\n\nStats Overview Section\nThe Detailed Metrics page gives us deeper dive into the stats for a given element within a section. Every Detailed Metrics page will include an expanded stats line, also including the 99.9% and 99.99% Percentile Bins. Having a look below we can see that 99.99% of messages processed for the Celsius Conversion pipeline are less than or equal to 66 milliseconds. We can also see that we have a median throughput of 49k. Both these stats representing the last 5 minutes of processing data from the incoming stream.\n\nGraphs Section\nPercent by Latency Graph\nThe first graph we'll see is the Percent by Latency Bin graph. This graph is grouped by the following bins on the x-axis: ≤ 1 μs, ≤ 4 μs, ≤ 16 μs, ≤ 66 μs, ≤ 260 μs, ≤ 1 ms, ≤ 4 ms, ≤ 16 ms, ≤ 66 ms, ≤ 260 ms, ≤ 1 s, > 1. Where the time unit represents the upper limit of that bin and the lower limit is the upper limit of the bin before it (or 0 for the first bin). Each bar representing the percent of latencies that fall within that bins range. With the y-axis representing the percentage for each bin.\nIf we look at our example below we can see that roughly 75% of our latencies for all messages processed within the last 5 minutes for the Celsius Conversion Pipeline are greater than 1 microsecond but less than or equal to half a millisecond.\n\nMedian Throughput per Second Graph\nThe second graph on our page is the Median Throughput per Second graph. The x-axis represents each second within the last 5 minutes of processing and the y-axis represents the median throughput. As we can see in the image below, our median throughput fluctuates between 48k and 50k.\n\nThe remaining sections on a Detailed Metrics page differ depending on the category the Detailed Metrics page represents.\nPipeline Detailed Metrics\n\nContinuing to look at the detailed metrics page for our Celsius Conversion pipeline, we'll see that we have two additional tables below our graphs section.\nPipeline by Worker Table\n\nThe first table is our Pipeline by Worker table, which in this case is titled Celsius Conversion by Worker. This table lists all of the workers which contribute to our Pipeline in order for us to get our metrics. The aggregation of the stats represented by each worker here will give us the total Pipeline stats that we saw above in the Stats Overview Section. Since we're running a single worker, the Celsius Conversion Pipeline stats and the Celsius Conversion by Worker stats for the Initializer will be exactly the same. Clicking on the Initializer link on this table will take us to the Pipeline by Worker detailed metrics page but we won't do that just yet.\nComputations for Pipeline Table\n\nThe second table is our Computations for Pipeline table, which in this case is titled Computations for Celsius Conversion. This section lists the computations being run for our Celsius Conversion pipeline and the Decode Time in TCP Source for the data being processed by this pipeline. We can see that we're running Add 32 and Multiply by 1.8 as the computations that make up our pipeline. Each computation provides its own stats line. Clicking on the title for each will take us to the Detailed Metrics page for that Computation.\nNow that we have an overview of the additional sections for our Pipeline Detailed Metrics page, let's go ahead and click on Initializer in our Celsius Conversion by Worker table to get to the Pipeline by Worker Detailed Metricspage.\nPipeline by Worker Detailed Metrics\n\nAs we can see above, the Pipeline by Worker detailed metrics page includes our two main sections: Stats Overview Section and Graphs Section.\nOne thing that is unique is that Celsius Conversion on Initializer title is broken into links where Celsius Conversion will direct us to our Pipeline Detailed Metrics page and Initializer will direct us to our Worker Detailed Metrics page so we don't have to navigate back to our Application Dashboard page in order to see the performance for those elements within their sections.\nThe other unique section on this page is the Computations for Pipeline on Worker table.\nComputations for Pipeline on Worker Table\n\nThe only additional table present on this page is our Computations for Pipeline on Worker table, which in this case is titled Computations for Celsius Conversion on Initializer. This table lists all of the computations which contribute to our Celsius Conversion pipeline that is running on the Initializer worker. Since this application is running as a single worker, we'll see that all of our computations for Celsius Conversion are running on this worker. We'll see the common stats lines that we expect for our tables. Clicking on the title of each computation will take us to our Computation by Worker page. So let's click on Add 32 and have a look.\nComputation by Worker Detailed Metrics\n\nAbove we can see the Computation by Worker detailed metrics page for our Add 32 computation running on our Initializer worker. Like our Pipeline by Worker Detailed Metrics page, our title will link us up to the Computation Detailed Metrics page and the Worker Detailed Metrics page. In this case, Add 32 and Initializer respectively.\nSince we've drilled down far as we can go for our metrics for a computation, there are no additional sections on this page.\nLet's click on Initializer in the title of the Stats Overview Section so we can go to our Worker Detailed Metrics page.\nWorker Detailed Metrics\n\nAbove we can see the Worker detailed metrics page for our Initializer worker. Once again we'll see our common Stats Overview Section and Graphs Section. In the case of a Worker Detailed Metrics page, there are 2 additional sections.\nPipelines on Worker Table\n\nThe first table is our Pipelines on Worker table, which in this case is titled Pipelines on Initializer. This table lists all of the pipelines which contribute to our worker in order for us to get our metrics. The aggregation of the stats represented by each pipeline here will give us the total worker stats that we see above in the Stats Overview Section. Since we're running a single pipeline for this application, the Initializer stats in the Stats Overview Section and the Pipelines on Initializer stats for the Celsius Conversion pipeline will be exactly the same. Clicking on the Celsius Conversion link on this table will take us to the Worker by Pipeline detailed metrics page but we won't do that just yet.\nComputations on Worker Table\n\nThe second table is our Computations on Worker table, which in this case is titled Computations on Initializer. This section lists the computations being run for all pipelines on the Initializer worker. We can see that we're running Add 32, Decode Time in TCP Source, and  Multiply by 1.8 as the computations that make up our Celsius Conversion pipeline. If we were to have any other pipelines running for a given application, they will show up here as well if running on this worker. Clicking on the title for each will take us to the Detailed Metrics page for that Computation.\nNow that we have an overview of the additional sections for our Worker Detailed Metrics page, let's go ahead and click on Celsius Conversion in our Pipelines on Initializer table to get to the Worker by Pipeline Detailed Metrics page.\nWorker by Pipeline Detailed Metrics\n\nLike all other detailed metrics pages, we include our common sections.\nAdditionally, our Celsius Conversion on Initializer title is broken into links where Celsius Conversion will direct us to our Pipeline Detailed Metrics page and Initializer will direct us to our Worker Detailed Metrics page.\nThere is a single additional section for this page.\nComputations for Pipeline on Worker Table\n\nThe only table on our page is our Computations for Pipeline on Worker table, which in this case is titled Computations for Celsius Conversion on Initializer. This table lists all of the computations which contribute to our Celsius Conversion pipeline that is running on the Initializer worker. As mentioned previously, since this application is running as a single worker, we'll see that all of our computations for Celsius Conversion are running on this worker.\nSince we've  already visited the Computation by Worker Detailed Metrics page above, let's use the navbar to visit the Add 32 Computation Detailed Metrics page.\n\nComputation Detailed Metrics\n\nAbove we can see the Computation Detailed Metrics page for our Add 32 computation. Once again we'll see our common Stats Overview Section and Graphs Section. There is one additional section for this page.\nComputation on Worker Table\n\nThe only table on our page is our Computation on Worker table, which in this case is titled Add 32 on Worker. This table lists all of the workers which contribute to our Add 32 computation. Since we're only running a single worker for this application, we'll only see Initializer in this list. The stats reported in the Stats Overview Section for our Computation Detailed Metrics page are a direct aggregation of each element in the Computations on Worker table. Since we only have one worker we can note that the stats are exactly the same.\nLimitations\nCurrently, the Metrics UI throughput graphs do not continue to update if new metrics data has not been processed. Thus the graphs represent the last 5 minutes of processed data. This will be addressed in a future release.\nConclusion\nBy this point, we've covered what the Metrics UI is and what Metrics are collected by the Metrics UI from Wallaroo. We have also gone over the pages that make up the Metrics UI. You should now be able to direct metrics from your own Wallaroo application to the Metrics UI and understand how to monitor your application.\n"},"book/appendix/decoding-giles-receiver-output.html":{"url":"book/appendix/decoding-giles-receiver-output.html","title":"Decoding Giles Receiver Output","keywords":"","body":"Decoding giles/receiver Output\nSince Giles-Receiver is designed to be a fast sink receiver, it doesn't decode the data it receives from Wallaroo, but instead saves as frame encoded binary data.\nAt some point, you will want to consume this data. Fallor allows you decode the frame encoded data to text.\nFallor Command-Line Options\nFallor takes the following arguments:\nPARAMETERS:\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--input/-i [Sets file to read from (default: received.txt)]\n--output/-o [Sets file to write to (default: fallor-readable.txt)]\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDecoded Structure\nGiles receiver stores data as frame-encoded tuples of (received timestamp, binary blob). As fallor decodes the file, it saves each decoded tuple in a new line, with the received timestamp, followed by a comma, a space, and the data received by giles-receiver--unchanged.\nIf the data received by giles-receiver was text, then it will show as text. However, if it the data is anything other than text, then that data will show as a binary blob, which may or may not be readable as text.\nThe next section describes how to create your own encoder if your application's output data is not text.\nBinary Data\nIf your application is sending binary encoded data from its sink, then even after decoding the receiver's output file, that data will still remain a binary data.\nIn order to decode that data, you will need to build your own decoder.\nThere are two ways to go about this:\n\nUse fallor to decode the receiver's output file, and then consume the file as text, splitting on the first comma, and treating the remainder of the line as binary data. This method only works if your binary data is guaranteed to not contain any new lines, however.\nWrite a custom decoder to for the giles-receiver output file your application generated.\n\nWriting a Custom Output File Decoder\nIf you need to write a custom file decoder for the giles-receiver output file, then may want to refer to the Giles-receiver output encoding section.\nTemplate Custom Output File Decoder in Python\nA Python template for a custom output file decoder is provided below. It requires click to be installed (sudo pip install click), but if you don't need a CLI, you can forego this requirement.\nIn this example, struct.unpack is used in conjunction with a user-defined unpacking specification.\nIn addition, the user may also determine if the msg_length included by giles/receiver should be used when unpacking the application's binary blob.\nFor example, if the binary data is a variable length string, then --format '>{}s' --size-dependent will tell the decoder to decode is a string.\nIf, instead, the binary data is a list of 32-bit signed integers, then the user will need to override (in the code) the fmt_function provided.\nA replacement function could be\ndef format_function(size):\n    # Divide size by 4 to get number of integers in the list\n    return '>{}I'.format(size/4)\n\n# run decode_file with the new format_function\ndecode_file(format_function, f_in, f_out)\n\nThe complete template is:\n\n# decoder.py\n\nimport click\nimport struct\nimport sys\n\n\ndef decode_msg(fmt, msg_data):\n    return struct.unpack(fmt, msg_data)\n\n\nLENGTH_WITH_TIMESTAMP_FMT = '>LQ'\nLENGTH_WITH_TIMESTAMP_LENGTH = 12\ndef decode_file(fmt_function, f_in, f_out):\n    # get file length\n    f_in.seek(0,2)\n    total_size = f_in.tell()\n    f_in.seek(0,0)\n\n    # start reading\n    while total_size > 0:\n        msg_len, ts = struct.unpack(LENGTH_WITH_TIMESTAMP_FMT, f_in.read(12))\n        total_size -= (12 + msg_len)\n        msg = struct.unpack(fmt_function(msg_len), f_in.read(msg_len))[0]\n        f_out.write(\", \".join((str(ts), msg)))\n        f_out.write(\"\\n\")\n\n\n@click.command()\n@click.option('--input', '-i', 'input_path', nargs=1, required=True, type=str,\n              help='Path of file to open for decoding')\n@click.option('--output', '-o', 'output_path', nargs=1, required=True, type=str,\n              help='Path of file to open for writing output')\n@click.option('--format', '-f', 'fmt', nargs=1, required=True, type=str,\n              help='format string to provide struct.unpack')\n@click.option('--size-dependent', '-s', 'size_dependent', is_flag=True, default=False,\n              help='Recompute format for message size')\ndef decode_cli(input_path, output_path, fmt, size_dependent):\n    with open(output_path, 'wb') as f_out:\n        with open(input_path, 'rb') as f_in:\n            if size_dependent:\n                # If you have multiple size-dependent arguments, replace this\n                # function with your own custom one!\n                fmt_function = lambda s: fmt.format(s)\n            else:\n                fmt_function = lambda s: fmt\n            decode_file(fmt_function, f_in, f_out)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    decode_cli()\n\n"},"book/appendix/wallaroo-and-long-running-data-processing-and-other-workflows.html":{"url":"book/appendix/wallaroo-and-long-running-data-processing-and-other-workflows.html","title":"Wallaroo and Long-Running Data Processing and Other Workflows","keywords":"","body":"Wallaroo and Long-Running Data Processing and Other Workflows\nWallaroo was designed to be a highly efficient and general purpose data processing engine, including event-by-event (stream) processing with microsecond response as well as other longer running tasks such as distributed logfile analysis or model training, and even real-time workflows that do not fit into standard real-time streaming topologies.

This directory will be populated with the Wallaroo source code when we start the container for the first time. It is to be noted that the Wallaroo Docker image will only copy the source code to an empty directory on the host so it is advised that you use an empty directory the first time you run the docker run command. The source code will persist on your machine until you decide to remove it. Throughout the documentation, we make the assumption that you've used the -v option with an empty directory and have the source code on your host machine.\nNow, you can modify any of the Python example applications, located under /tmp/wallaroo-docker/wallaroo-src/examples/python, using the editor of your choice on your machine.\nIf you decide to not use the -v mount option for Wallaroo source code, code will be copied to /src/wallaroo only within the Docker container. You will have to use an editor within the container. Currently, only Vim is provided. Other editors can be installed via apt-get, however they will not persist after the container is killed. Any code changes will also not persist.\nNote: When mounting a volume for the Wallaroo source code (ca. 104mb), we place it in the /tmp folder. Most hosts delete files in the /tmp directory after a certain period of time. If you'd like the code to persist, we advise using a different directory (ex. $HOME/wallaroo-docker/wallaroo-src).\nInstalling Python modules in Virtualenv\nWhen we start the Wallaroo Docker image with the -v /tmp/wallaroo-docker/python-virtualenv:/src/python-virtualenv option, as described in the Run a Wallaroo Application in Docker section, we will be creating a new directory locally at /tmp/wallaroo-docker/python-virtualenv if it does not exist, which will create a persistent Python virtualenv directory on your machine.\nNow, anytime you enter the Wallaroo Docker image with the bash docker exec -it wally env-setup command, you will automatically be in the Wallaroo virtualenv and can install modules using pip install or easy_install. These modules will persist even if you exit the container and re enter as long as you start with the same mount options for the virtualenv directory. It is to be noted that any modules that are installed via apt-get will not persist beyond the lifecycle of the container.\n"},"book/legal/terms.html":{"url":"book/legal/terms.html","title":"Terms and Conditions","keywords":"","body":"Wallaroo Community License Agreement\nPlease read this Wallaroo Community License Agreement (the \"Agreement\") carefully before using Wallaroo (as defined below), which is offered by Wallaroo Labs, Inc. or its affiliated Legal Entities (\"Wallaroo Labs\"). \nBy downloading Wallaroo or using it in any manner, You agree that You have read and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
